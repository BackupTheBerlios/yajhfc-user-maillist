Hi,

this is a bug in 0.5.0.

Please try if version 0.5.1beta1 from
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/beta/ 
fixes this problem (except for the bugfix it is identical to 0.5.0).


Hope that helps
Jonas

Hello,

in case you (or other users) are still interested, I think I have found a 
workaround for this problem:

If you try it, please let me know if it works for you or not...

Best regards

Yes, it works.
Is this a setting that could be enabled by  the win installer if
running on win7?

I'm trying to view sent faxes and in: Command like for Postscript viewer:

and fax closes as soon as it open. When I try from command line: gs file.ps I can view it, it is not closing.

The reason for that behaviour is that YajHFC closes the stdin stream of the 
viewer once it has been started.
When stdin is closed for gs, it closes.

The solution for that problem is not to use plain gs as a viewer for faxes 
since it is not intended to be used as such.
Please use some postscript viewer application instead (evince, okular, gv, 
...).

Hope that helps
