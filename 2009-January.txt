Subject: [Yajhfc-user] YajHFC 0.4.0beta released
Message-ID: <200901011219.06362.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

I am pleased to announce that version 0.4.0beta of YajHFC has been released 
today.

Download:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_4_0beta.jar

Source code: 
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_4_0beta-src.zip

Windows setup.exe: 
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_4_0beta-setup.exe

This is the first time there is an "official" beta of YajHFC due to the many 
internal changes this version incorporates. 
There are currently no known bugs, but all users are encouraged to test this 
version in their environment before using it in production (and provide 
feedback if a problem is found).

New features/changes:
- Support for archive directory
- Support to view and send faxes as a single file (in PDF, TIFF or PS format)
- Phone book includes most common fields now
- Support for a tray icon under Java 6
- Improved options dialog
- Improved command line support (YajHFC can now be
used to send faxes without user confirmation)
- Some simple obfuscation for passwords
- Lots of internal code clean up

For more information you may also take a look at the homepage at:

Have Fun and Happy New Year,
Jonas

Hi Jonas

I have been using the latest beta of yajhfc with no problems thanks.

But I do have a question about the new archive view.

Currently when I log into yajhfc I go under my usuall logon details for a
general user, and in the archive I can only view faxes which I have sent
which is what I would expect.

However when I change to admin mode under the same username, in the
archive view I would expect to be able to see all users sent faxes, but I
can't I can still only see the ones which I haev sent.  Should it work
this way?

In archive, should I also be able to delete a file which has been
archived?  When I try I get "java.io.IOException: Could not delete the
file" errors.  Or is this something that can't be done or would it be an
actual file premission problem on the actual server?  This happens in
normal & admin mode.

Thanks

Andy

The archive view completely bypasses the HylaFAX server and uses the file 
system directly (theoretically it would work without even connecting to 
HylaFAX). 
Because of that the only permissions taking effect are the "normal" file 
permissions on the server -- so it is no bug when the admin mode does not 
change anything here.

Nevertheless it is a bit odd that you can only view faxes sent by yourself (as 
long as "View->Only own faxes" is *not* checked, of course ;-) ).
Most likely this is a permission problem, but it also might be a bug in YajHFC 
(because the archive code has not been tested very much so far).

You can check for a permission problem by browsing the archive directory with 
a file manager on the client and trying if you can open the "qX" files inside 
the sub directories of the archive directory (where X is the name of the sub 
directory).

For example, if you cannot see job 123, check if you can 
open "archive/123/q123" with a text editor. 
If you can read this file on the client, but YajHFC does not show that job, 
this is a bug in YajHFC.

Similarly you can check if deleting jobs fails due to a bug in YajHFC or due 
to a permission problem: If you can delete the subdirectory belonging to the 
job with a file manager, but not with YajHFC, it is a bug. 

For example, if YajHFC cannot delete job 123, check if you can remove the 
directory "archive/123".

Regards,
Jonas

Thanks, this is a bug. It has been fixed in the current developer version (and 
of course for the 0.4.0 release).

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] fax send button
Message-ID: <363483.99203.qm@web32605.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I don't know if others have experienced this but sometimes users send a fax twice simply because they pressed the "send button" twice (or more if they're quick enough).
This is due to the fact that at times my hylafax server is a bit slow or there's a network congestion. So the yajhfc "send fax" dialog doesn't close right after the first "click".

Maybe the yajhfc code could "disable" the send button when clicked once (or some other workaround).

Cheers,

Vieri

Thanks for pointing that out. The release version of 0.4.0 will disable the 
send button after the first click so that this is no longer possible.
