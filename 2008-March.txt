Hi!

Sorry for the dumb question but I noticed that the job
dates on the server don't match the job date displayed
on the YAJHFC grid. There's a 1-hour difference. The
Hylafax server's time is correct and is 1h+. I know I
could set +1h in YAJHFC's options but I'd rather tell
the client to just display the time Hylafax is sending
back.

Can this be done?
I'm sure it's a silly detail I'm overlooking.

Thanks!

Vieri

If you don't set an offset, YajHFC displays exactly the time the server is 
sending back.

You can try experimenting with the time zone setting in the options dialog 
(under "Delivery") and see if it helps (the time zone correction is done by 
the server, not by YajHFC).

Hope that helps,
Jonas

That's strange. I've checked the Hylafax server logs
and the date is fine everywhere (in the log file
related to a given fax transaction, for example).

You meant, under "Server tab" I suppose. There, I set
+1 hour and now the time is displayed correctly. If
it's the server making the correction and not the
client then I guess that Hylafax is not sending the
system date but calculates the GMT and sends that
instead?
My timezone is GMT+1 so I guess that could make sense.
However, I find it an inconvenience to set +1 in
YAJHFC. I also believe that my real local time isn't
GMT+1 year-round (at some point and for a brief period
I think that the legal time is GMT+2 then it comes
back to GMT+1).

Anyway, if you say that it's on the server side then I
guess I'll have to dig into the Hylafax documentation
and see if there's anything about GMT.

Thanks!

No, in the delivery tab there is a combo box where you can set the time zone 
(you can choose between GMT and the local time zone).

This is not really logical and I'll move this back to the server tab with the 
next version ("historically" server and delivery settings were on the same 
tab, when I separated them this combo box went into the delivery tab by 
mistake...).

Regards,
Jonas

Ok, I set that. However, whether I select GMT or local
I always get the same time (ie. our hour less than the
server's local time).

I think that the bug is on the hylafax server.
I found a "recent" post which seems to indicate that
older Hylafax versions seem to have had an issue with
GMT/local time.
http://www.hylafax.org/archive/2007-12/msg00015.php

I tested other Hylafax clients and have the same date
problem.

I'm running hylafax 4.2.5 which is relatively old so
maybe upgrading to 4.3.7 or going to the 4.4 branch
will solve my problem.

Thanks for the feedback.

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] redirect script to yajhfc
Message-ID: <762175.96402.qm@web32606.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi again.

I have been using 0_3_4 flawlessly until I upgraded
today to 0_3_6.

The only problem I'm having is surely due to my custom
script on Windows XP.
The redirected printer port is configured as:

program: cscript.exe
argument: C:\FHM_FAX\CLIENTS\yajhfc-redmon.vbs
hidden, run as user

The content of yajhfc-redmon.vbs is:

dim wshhell, userprofile, java

Set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:" & _
    "{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\.\root\cimv2")
Set colOperatingSystems = objWMIService.ExecQuery _
  ("Select * from Win32_OperatingSystem")
For Each objOperatingSystem In colOperatingSystems
    intOSType = objOperatingSystem.OSType
    strOSVer = Left(objOperatingSystem.Version, 3)
Next
Select Case intOSType
    Case 16 'Windows 95
        intOSVer = 1
    Case 17 'Windows 98
        intOSVer = 2
    Case 18
        Select Case strOSVer
            Case 4.0
                intOSVer = 4 'Windows NT 4.0
            Case 5.0
                intOSVer = 5 'Windows 2000
            Case 5.1
                intOSVer = 6 'Windows XP
            Case 5.2
                intOSVer = 7 'Windows Server 2003
            Case Else
                intOSVer = 0 'Older or newer version
            End Select
    Case Else
        intOSVer = 0 'Older or newer version
End Select
If intOSVer = 1 OR intOSVer = 2 Then ' This is an old
Windows (95 or 98)

userprofile = "C:\FHM_FAX\PROFILE"

else

userprofile =
wshshell.regread("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile
Environment\HOMEDRIVE") &
wshshell.regread("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile
Environment\HOMEPATH")
'wscript.echo "userprofile = " & userprofile

end if

set java = WshShell.Exec("java.exe -Duser.home=""" &
userprofile & """ -classpath
C:\FHM_FAX\JDBC\mysql-connector-java-5.0.4-bin.jar;C:\FHM_FAX\CLIENTS\yajhfc.jar
yajhfc.Launcher --stdin")

Do While (java.status = 0 and not
wscript.stdin.atendofstream)
	java.stdin.write wscript.stdin.read(4000)
loop
java.stdin.close

With 0_3_4, yajhfc shows up with the "send dialog box"
where the user just needs to type the phone number.
However, with 0_3_6, yajhfc shows up without the "send
dialog box". The application runs (is operational) and
does not quit. The user can flip through the different
tabs and see the job list. But the data sent through
the virtual printer system is unavailable. As if
--stdin did not work.

What could be wrong with my vbs script?

Hmm, your script seems to work for me here.

Do you have any log files?

I would be interested in both the redmon log file (configured using the "Log 
file" button in the virtual printer port configuration) and the yajhfc log 
file (add the parameters "--debug --logfile=<logfile location>" to the 
command line starting yajhfc in the vbs script).

Thanks,
Jonas

Yajhfc 0.3.4 does not have the logfile option so I can
only compare the redmon logs.

I noticed that the first differences between the two
versions are the following two lines found only in
0.3.6 + redmon:

REDMON check_process: process isn't running.
REDMON check_process: flushing child stdin to unblock
WriteThread.

I guess that's where stdin is getting dumped.

I am attaching the complete logs.

Any ideas greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Vieri

Yes, later (after all the PostScript) it says:
C:\FHM_FAX\CLIENTS\yajhfc-redmon.vbs(48, 2) (null): Se est? cerrando la 
canalizaci?n.
I identified this as "Se est? cerrando la canalizaci?n." which seems to 
mean "The pipe is being closed." according to some Googling. 
From the YajHFC logs I also found that showing the Send dialog seems to fail 
somehow (probably an uncaught Exception happens somewhere...).

So:
Can you open the send dialog manually by clicking the toolbar button or does 
this not work either?

If this does not work, please run YajHFC from a command line window to see if 
there is a stack trace printed when you try to open the window.
If it is, please send me that output.

Thanks,
Jonas

yes, I can.
I did exactly the same steps as in the log I sent, but
since the send dialog box does not appear, I clicked
on File -> Send and it appeared just fine (but without
stdin data, of course).
I also did the same with the toolbar button.

Not applicable since the window opens.

Could it be a newly-introduced permissions/java
security problem with redmon/yajhfc?

I consider this quite unlikely. I did no security related changes between 
0.3.4 and 0.3.6 (the code used for --stdin did change however, so I might 
have introduced a bug there...).

I noticed, however, that with the current print launch scripts any output from 
yajhfc will be discarded and not show up in the redmon logs (which is no 
problem unless you are debugging ;-) ).

Please replace the loop at the end of your script with the following code to 
capture the yajhfc output and ignore the "pipe closed" error. Then send me a 
new redmon log:

Do While (java.status = 0 and not wscript.stdin.atendofstream)
	on error resume next
        java.stdin.write wscript.stdin.read(4000)
	if (err <> 0) then
	   Wscript.echo "Error #" & CStr(Err.Number) & ": " & Err.Description
           Err.Clear
        end if
loop
java.stdin.close
wscript.stdout.write java.stdout.readAll()
wscript.stderr.write java.stderr.readAll()


Thanks,
Jonas
