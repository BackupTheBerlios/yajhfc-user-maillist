Subject: [Yajhfc-user] OpenOffice plugin for YajHFC
Message-ID: <200710102101.09724.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

I created a small OpenOffice plugin that adds a toolbar button to send the 
current document as a fax with YajHFC.

You can download it at:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/download/yajhfc-OO-plugin.zip

Currently it only has been tested with OpenOffice 2.3 in Linux, but it should 
work with other versions/operating systems, too.

If it does not work for you or if you have any feedback about it, please let 
me know.

Have fun,
Jonas

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Fax Cover Page and Word Wrap/Length of Comments
Message-ID: <B55301ABE760AA49BE5ADB32BF27A336066E53@claims-new>

I use Yajhfc as a windows client and its great.  I also like to put a
lot of notes/comments on my cover pages.  Often if I'm faxing a document
to someone,  rather than writing a separate cover letter for
instructions, etc, I like to use the fax cover sheet.  Yajhfc seems to
create forced word wrap that corresponds to the size of the send dialog
box.  On the final fax, this comments area ends up being a small column
that does not use the full page width.  Also, there seems to be a limit
as to how many lines of the comments will get transmitted, but no
indication that the comments have been truncated.

 

Any way we can get the cover page comments to only respond to /n (new
line) or word wrap at full page width?  And get a visual indicator that
the comments are too long?

 

Thanks,

Difficult (see explanation below).

Should be possible.

The YajHFC cover page code has been ported directly from the HylaFAX C++ 
client code, so that it may use the same PostScript cover page format (this 
is not exactly required, however, as the HylaFAX server accepts any 
PostScript file as a cover page).

Unfortunately that code does all the word wrapping in PostScript and as I 
don't know any PostScript it is quite difficult for me to change that 
behaviour.
What I know is that the code seems to wrap always after 35 characters (not 
after a certain width) and that it supports a maximum of 9 lines of text.
So a visual indicator about those limitations should be doable.

To be honest I am also a bit dissatisfied about the current cover page support 
in YajHFC especially because there is no really user friendly cover page 
designer out there.
On the other hand I don't want to spend a lot of time writing my own cover 
page editor and I also don't know of any open source/freeware editor I could 
use (if any reader knows one, please tell me!).

To make it short: 
Some visual indication will probably be implemented in the next version, but 
a "clean" solution to the problem will probably take a bit longer.

Greetings,
Jonas

I have not looked at the code, nor do I have much experience with Java
(I do mostly Database stuff with Delphi).  However, based on the
behavior, I think the comments area is simply stored in an array.  I
think the word wrap is actually being done by the memo/edit control of
Java.  Thus, when the code passes the memo.lines[] array of strings to
the cover page code, it does not reformat them, just passes each line
un-modified.  This is probably the correct behavior.  As a test of my
theory, if the dialog box was resizable, and thus the memo control could
be made bigger, I expect each line would get appropriately longer. 

While on the subject of Cover pages, I would like to suggest a minor
change in the send dialog.  I am a big fan of producing interfaces that
are workable from the keyboard without having to go to the mouse unless
desired.  The two-tabbed approach breaks this for me.  If we could
combine these tabs into one larger dialog, or move the cover page stuff
to the front tab, and relegate the file input box and other options to
the second tab, I think it might flow better.  Of course, I almost only
use this from a --stdin perspective.  It may make more sense the way it
is if you do a lot of sending from files.  In that case, maybe a switch
internally that shows different dialogs for --stdin & launching directly
from the UI?

Also,  I tried to use .3.5 and while it works from the UI, I cannot get
it to work from --stdin and Redmon.  I am using Vista, which has been
difficult to get to work at all, but I'm now pretty stable with .3.4a
and the CScript.  


Thanks for such a great program

Sorry, but I *know* for sure that the string I get from the "memo" (JTextArea) 
is not wrapped (at least when I output it to the console for testing).
You can confirm that behaviour by entering a line 
containing "iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii..."  and another line 
containing "WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW..." into the comment area. On the screen 
much more i's than W's will fit in a line while on the cover page the number 
will be the same.

Making the dialog box resizable should be no problem and is a good idea, 
however.

I will think about it but I don't want to promise anything right now (you 
certainly have a point here...).

As I currently don't own a Vista copy for testing, could you tell some details 
about "how" 0.3.5 does not work in Vista (does it start, is the Send dialog 
shown, is there no data/is it corrupted, ...)?

BTW, did you have to use any "special tricks" (apart from using the 
yajhfc-launch.vbs script) to get 0.3.4a to work with Redmon on Vista?
If yes, could you maybe give a short description of what you had to do (to 
make life a bit easier for other users)?

Thanks again for your feedback,
Jonas

Sorry it took me a while to respond to this, but I couldn't remember all
the issues I had with my workstation.  I also knew that I was getting
ready to setup a new Vista station, so I wanted to do it 'from scratch'.
I ran the 'windows setup' release (I think this actually has 3.3?).  And
this bombed due to not being able to find a proper PS driver (Vista does
not come with the Apple Drivers ... go figure).  However, it did install
Redmon, and setup the Virtual Port.
I then copies the 3.5 jar into c:\Yajhfc as well as the
yajhfc-launch.vbs file.  I corrected all the paths and file names, setup
the redmon port to call cscripte.exe and pointed it at the VBS file and
it seems to be working just fine.  I think I am using an HP Laserjet 4
driver.

So, I'll rescind my statement that 3.5 is broken.  Apparently I need to
dig a little deeper on my personal workstation, as on the fresh install
I did this weekend, it seems to have gone Ok, except for the initial
install problem of Apple drivers.

No problem for me. It's better to wait a few days than to get "incorrect" 
feedback. ;-)

OK, fine. If the selection of the printer driver is the only problem with 
Vista, adding Vista support to the Setup should be pretty easy to do.
As I will probably get access to a Vista installation during the next few 
weeks, this might be done soon.

It is of course still perfectly possible that this is caused by problems in 
0.3.5 since I had to change the login code to add the progress bar (so 0.3.5 
*might* behave a bit different from 0.3.4a).
If you have any new findings please let me know.

Thanks again for your feedback,
