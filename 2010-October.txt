Win7 64bit, java 32 bit 6u21, yajhfc 0.4.4.

When YajHFC is running you can see the javaw.exe process in task manager.
Is there a way to start YajHFC in a way that will show "yajhfc.something" in
the process list?

My immediate issue is that I need to create a very small app which will
edit/create the ".yajhfc/settings" file with settings all users should be
using, or reset it to some default values if the user misconfigured it.

To do this I need to kill YajHFC is it's running and restart it later, but I
cannot detect is YajHFC is running because I cannot find any reference to it
in the process list.

Thanks.

None that I am aware of...

Wouldn't the settings.override mechanism of YajHFC work for you in that case?

Simply put a file named settings.override in the .yajhfc directory. When 
YajHFC is loaded the settings inside that file always override the ones the 
user specified the last time.
(also see http://yajhfc.berlios.de/doc/faq.html#SECTION000310000000000000000 )


Hope that helps
Jonas

I assume I have to restart yajhfc for the new settings to take effect.

The reason I wanted to terminate the process was to be able to tell the user
	"run the config app" (which would kill the running yajhfc by itself)
instead of
	"close the running yajhfc session"
	"run the config app"
	"restart yajhfc"

this is because there are users who will ask "how do I close yajhfc?" "how
do I restart it?"

I'll try to find a workaround.

you might try using "handle" from SysInternals and parsing its output.

Hi all,

I am wanting to do an LDAP lookup using YAJHFC for the phonebook.
I have an OU that is below another?that I with to only retreive this

The LDAP is: ou=first,ou=second,dc=domain,dc=com

This fails, if?I use: ou=first,dc=domain,dc=com
It will succeed.

Can anyone assist with this as I am wanting to call on sub OU's.

Many thanks anyone.

Hi,
first of all thaks a lot for your software.

The question is: is it possible to obtain a printable fax notification without 
email?

email is sent by server software, not by client software. If you want to
print notification of received faxes, just modify your faxrcvd command
in order to print it on any printer.

Bye,
Giuseppe
