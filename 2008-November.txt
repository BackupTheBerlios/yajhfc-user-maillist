Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Fetching Fax List Problem
Message-ID: <2338.62.49.140.10.1225959092.squirrel@webmail.plus.net>

Hi All

I have been running a Hylafax Fax Server for the past 3 months now, and
have been using yajhfc for my client application which is excellent.

I have now started to run into a problem when starting yajhfc when it is
showing the "Fetching Fax List" dialog box it takes a little time but then
it stops and I get an error message at the bottom saying "Error refreshing
the status: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset by peer: socket
write error".

If I run yajhfc about 4 times it will eventually give my the current fax
list.

I do have approx 1300+ items in my list at present, but iam restricted in
this as my boss wants the history keeping for 3 months.

Other client applications for Hylafax seem to have no problems listing
this big fax queue.

Is there any way to get yajhfc to work with bigger fax lists but without
having to run it approx 4 times, or is there a way in yajhfc to restrict
it to only display the last 2-3 weeks of fax's instead?

Thanks in Advance.

Andy

This is strange. In a quick test with my test configuration YajHFC had no 
problems loading and displaying a list of 2000 faxes (so it should work in 
theory...).

Could you send me a debug log of YajHFC for this problem?

To create such a log, simply use the "YajHFC (debug mode)" link to start 
YajHFC if you installed it using the Windows setup.

Else, please add the command line parameters "--debug --logfile=c:\yajhfc.log" 
when starting YajHFC (i.e. use a command line like "java -jar 
yajhfc.jar --debug --logfile=c:\yajhfc.log" to start it).


Additionally, you could also try if using the following developer version is 
of any help:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc.jar

This version includes a newer version of the gnu.hylafax-library YajHFC uses 
to connect to the server, which may (or may not) be of help in your case.

Unfortunately, no. The list can only be retrieved as a whole from the HylaFAX 
server (this is a restriction of the protocol).
As far as I can tell at this time, the problem you experience occurs while the 
list is retrieved from the server (the connection is reset) and not while 
YajHFC is parsing/displaying it, so any filtering done after retrieving that 
list would probably not be of much help.


Best regards,
Jonas

Thanks for the logs.
After looking at them I think that the latest beta will probably fix your 
problem.

While working on another issue I noticed that gnu.hylafax uses a socket 
timeout of 10 seconds by default. In the beta this timeout is disabled (i.e. 
YajHFC will wait (almost) indefinitely).

According to your logs the problem (connection reset) always occurs exactly 10 
seconds after the transfer of the fax list has started, so it is quite likely 
that the socket timeout is the reason for that.

It works on the fourth try because the fax list is transferred there much 
quicker (in 3 seconds), probably because that list is in the server's cache 
at that time. 
In the beta YajHFC should wait long enough for the server, so that the 
transfer will probably succeed in the first try.


If it still does not work, please let me know (it is not impossible that there 
are other timeout values which need to be adjusted, too).

Jonas

I had the same problem (with 2340 faxes). The lastest beta fixes it, thanks!

BTW, I had a problem with waiting indefinitely in another case. I had unconfigured
nf_conntrack_ftp module (ports=21,4559 was not added), so the connection
to the server timed out. I waited about a minute, but was not able to use or
even close YajHFC. I had to kill java.exe.

To clarify - I was able to log in, but fetching fax list hung indefinitely and I had
to kill java.

Was this with the beta from yesterday or an older version?

With older, but now tried beta - first time after 20-30 seconds "Fetching fax list"
went away, status was Disconnected and I was able to close YajHFC normally.
Second time progress bar in "Fetching fax list" stopped scrolling after about 30
seconds and the program hung. I had to kill javaw.exe.

In the beta from yesterday it waits until the OS considers the TCP connection 
to be broken (how long this is is of course OS dependent).

In the current version the timeout is configurable with a default of 90 
seconds.

Thanks for the logs. 
Please try the current beta. YajHFC will still show "Fetching fax list" for 
some time (until the OS has given up retransmitting the TCP SYN packets -- a 
few minutes at my Linux box here), but you should be able to close it without 
killing Java.

Jonas

It's OK now, thanks - "Fetching fax list" disappears in about half a minute.

Hi Jonas

I have been using the latest version of yajhfc 0.39rc2 and seems to be
working well thanks.

However one problem that Iam seeing, similar to the other user who had a
similar problem with "Fetching Fax List", is with the latest release I see
their is now a new option of "Disconnect".

I have used this, but when I goto reconnect using "Connect" under the
option menu the "Fetching Fax List" box remains on screen all the time,
and fails to get the fax list.  And If I try and quit yajhfc I have to end
up killing the Java application from my task list.

It is only when I try to reconnect this way this actually happens.

Another Idea maybe would to have a Connect/Disconnect icon on the toolbar
maybe aswell for this added feature, like the other control icons already
their.

Thanks

Andy

Hmm, I think I found a small bug which may cause this and updated the build at 
ftp.berlios.de accordingly.
Please try if this works for you; if not, please send me some debug logs for 
it.

This may be useful, but I won't add that for 0.3.9 yet (but maybe in the next 
version after that).

Thanks,
Jonas

Thanks for the quick update, so far so good.  It seems to be working as I
have not been able to crash it like I could with the other version.

Yeah sure that would be great,

Thanks Again

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] New French translator needed
Message-ID: <200811251827.57205.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

Hi to all,

as the current French translators seem not to react to mails, a new French 
translator is needed for YajHFC.

So: If any user of the French translation is interested in updating the 
translation f?r future versions of YajHFC (usually this involves translating 
at most 20-30 messages per release), please let me know.


Thanks,
Jonas

P.S.: 
If one of the current translators reads this and wants to continue his work, 
please let me know, too (you are of course still welcome; maybe your mails 
did not reach me or my mails did not reach you -- please post a short note to 
this list if this is the case).

I don't mind helping out.
Just mail me the messages and I'll take a look at them.

OK, thank you very much!

I will contact you about a week before the next release to update the 
translations (if you need an updated translation earlier, just let me know, 
however).

Today the old translator has mailed me that he has been away for a few weeks 
and wants to continue his work.
So I will try the old translator again for the next release(s) and come back 
to you in case he is away again (I hope you don't mind ;-) ).

He also sent me an updated translation for 0.3.9. 
So you now can download a JAR file with the updated French translation from:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0_3_9-fr.jar

Apart from the French translation, this file is completely identical to 0.3.9, 
so I won't create a new release here.

Regards,
Jonas
