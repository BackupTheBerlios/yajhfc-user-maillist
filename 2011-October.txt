Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Line break allowed in "Street" field?
Message-ID: <20111010165131.17443smxq05f5g8z@topdeck.tinsleyviaduct.com>

I have installed yajhfc on two Debian machines (my hylafax server  
resides on a third) and been very impressed with the tests I have  
done. After some struggle, I modified the cover page to a layout that  
suits me slightly better. One of the fields used on it is "Street", as  
entered into identities and phone book entries.

I have an address "line" that is actually best broken up into two  
lines. Is it possible to enter a line break in the middle? This would  
make the result even neater, but I can cope with it if not.

It is currently not possible to add a line break in any other field than the 
Comments field.
I hope this does not cause too much inconvenience for you...

Because berlios.de will close down on 2011-12-31 YajHFC moves to a new 
location at http://www.yajhfc.de 
Please update your bookmarks accordingly.


The source code repository and issue tracker will now be hosted on Google Code 
at http://code.google.com/p/yajhfc.

The mailing lists will move to Google Groups accordingly.
Current Members of the mailing lists will receive an invitation to join the 
new Groups (but of course it is up to you to join them or not).

You will need a Google account to join the new Groups; if that is an issue for 
you, please let me know.

I will not remove the old content from berlios.de or close the old mailing 
lists before the end of the year; new releases/updates etc. will only be made 
on yajhfc.de, however.

Since the new home page contains a lot of stuff ported from the old one, 
please let me know if you find any dead links or have any questions/feedback 
about this change.


Have fun
Jonas Wolz
