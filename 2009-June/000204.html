<PRE>Hi,

I'm currently testing your HylaFAX client and I'm impressed. Thanks for your work.

My tests brought me to some issues/questions:

- When I've lost the connection HylaFAX (e.g. the server was restarted) YajHFC is in disconnected state. When I try to fax something after this happened the cmd.exe with cscript starts and just hangs. I see the splash screen and that's it. I've to kill and restart the YajHFC.

- I'm also interested in a &quot;send only mode&quot;. I want the fax users are able to send faxes, but they shouldn't see the inbox.

- The PDF-conversion with libtiff for windows crashes under Windows Vista. Do you know some workaround/solution for that?

- Is it possible to put it YajHFC in autostart as tray-only (no main window)?

- Is it possible to add easily a command which will be executed by YajHFC before it connects to HylaFAX (I know for startup this could also be done by a script, but not after hibernation)? For notebook users I have sometimes the problem that the automatic DNS registrations takes some time. When the fax-client logs on it will be rejected because the DNS-IP differs from the notebook-IP.
  &gt; Maybe this could be added directly to YajHFC that it registers the IP in DNS before starting a connection (this can be done with ipconfig /registerdns)?

- Is there a way of central configuration for the options?


So, that's it for the moment... :-)

Thanks, Klaus
