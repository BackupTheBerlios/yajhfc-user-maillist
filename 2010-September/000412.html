<PRE>Hi,

the thing with security is actually pretty bad.
If you only have one fax extension you just have the possibility to secure all or no faxes.

The thing with RecvFileMode: 0600 has some drawbacks:
- Nobody will be able to display the faxes (so there's no need for a fully featured fax client at all)
- You're not able to watch the content, but the faxes still appear in the received/sent fax list

Just consider the following scenario:
- Small company with 10 employees, no Exchange Server (only POP3)
- Incoming faxes go to the secretaries mailbox and will be distributed from there
- The boss doesn't want the faxes in the mailbox, but wants to be able to display them anytime (without having access to the secretaries mailbox)
- All other users should only be able to send faxes

RecvFileMode: 0600 will prevent also the boss from displaying faxes.

In my opinion the only chance to implement that scenario is on the client side.
- Fully featured client for the boss and the secretary
- Send only client for all others

And you still have the HylaFAX logon table with user and password (even if it's not the safest method).

The only thing that needs to be implemented:
- If you &quot;upgrade&quot; from the send-only to the fully featured version you need to enter the password again (which the end user doesn't know).

If anyone has another solution for that scenario, please tell me.

Thanks, Klaus


BTW: Another cool thing would be a centralized management option split up in a global and an user specific part (two files).

I've never been able to get that to work out &quot;of the box&quot;

I've been trying all day to get pam to authenticate, I've tried ldap, winbind and radius, none of which have worked.
the radius one is even seeing the username, but not authenticating. I love linux, but when it comes to authenticating outside of the local box, it's a pain in the bits

why don't you get hylafax use your AD via PAM (winbind) for checking credentials? It should work ouf of the box, did you try it?
