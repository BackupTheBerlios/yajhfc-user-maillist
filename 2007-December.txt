Hi,

You've posted a message (below) in regards to a message of mail not being delivered "550 Submission from dynamic IP x.x.x.x Requires Authentication".

It seems that we have the same problem with our MX, to what list do we need to subscribe to pass this error?

Thank you.

Jaime

Hi Jonas,

I suddenly can't send email to @freenet.de because:
"
194.97.50.153 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550 Submission from dynamic IP
requires authentication Giving up on 194.97.50.153.
"

Our MX don't have dynamic IPs so it's probably a spam
measure based on IP ranges not well updated.

Anyway I subscribed to this list and it may very well
be the fisrt post...

So here's the answer to the message you sent me
yesterday:

From: Jonas Wolz :

continuation using

the second has the real status message in the first
column and the third line contains the rest of the
"logical > line" offset by 2 columns).

rest of the code is identical to 0.3.2).

Thank you Jonas, your new code solves the problem.
Hylafax job 366 which was "behaving badly" due to the
backslash is now displayed correctly.
I will simply rename the new code to 0.3.2 so that our
users don't notice anything.

Regards,

Vieri
