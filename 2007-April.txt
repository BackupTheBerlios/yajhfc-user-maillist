Great!
I'm only having trouble getting LDAP to grab data
because I get:

LDAP: error code 4 - Sizelimit Exceeded

but that's probably a server-side limitation I must
investigate.

The rest works perfectly (printing "sent faxes" table
is useful - and of course "resending" is great
although we haven't mass tested it yet).

Maybe the following link helps:
http://www.ldapadministrator.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14

The LDAP phone book is currently quite simple minded and just reads all 
entries below the Base DN matching the object filter and uses them as phone 
book entries.
Since I tested it only against a "toy" LDAP directory with about 10 entries so 
far, I don't really know how this performs with many entries (as you will 
probably have).

On the other hand, this (or other) problems could very well also be on my side 
since this is actually one of first attempts to access LDAP programmatically 
(using the Java JNDI classes).

Regards,
Jonas

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] command line option to force specific table view
Message-ID: <20070413095730.92892.qmail@web32602.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi Jonas,

maybe a command line option to force a specific table
to show up after a virtual printing redirection could
be a useful feature.
For instance, whenever a user sends a fax out through
redmon then it may be appropriate for the admin to
specify that the TRANSMIT table be displayed.

I haven't had time to download the new version, but I'm very excited
about the ability to re-send.

I've been using a variety of Hylafax front ends (for Windows) and so far
this is my favorite.

My wish list:

1:  Pause/hold fax jobs (this would work great with re-send).
2:  Tweat the send dialog to be more user-friendly when using Yajhfc as
a fax-printer.  Ie, I am using Redmon and directing output to yajhfc.
I'd like the main tab to have the fields for Number/recipient, etc, and
all other options put on the secondary tab. 

Thanks for your hard work .. This is a great program.

Mike Wilson
