<PRE>I have not looked at the code, nor do I have much experience with Java
(I do mostly Database stuff with Delphi).  However, based on the
behavior, I think the comments area is simply stored in an array.  I
think the word wrap is actually being done by the memo/edit control of
Java.  Thus, when the code passes the memo.lines[] array of strings to
the cover page code, it does not reformat them, just passes each line
un-modified.  This is probably the correct behavior.  As a test of my
theory, if the dialog box was resizable, and thus the memo control could
be made bigger, I expect each line would get appropriately longer. 

While on the subject of Cover pages, I would like to suggest a minor
change in the send dialog.  I am a big fan of producing interfaces that
are workable from the keyboard without having to go to the mouse unless
desired.  The two-tabbed approach breaks this for me.  If we could
combine these tabs into one larger dialog, or move the cover page stuff
to the front tab, and relegate the file input box and other options to
the second tab, I think it might flow better.  Of course, I almost only
use this from a --stdin perspective.  It may make more sense the way it
is if you do a lot of sending from files.  In that case, maybe a switch
internally that shows different dialogs for --stdin &amp; launching directly
from the UI?

Also,  I tried to use .3.5 and while it works from the UI, I cannot get
it to work from --stdin and Redmon.  I am using Vista, which has been
difficult to get to work at all, but I'm now pretty stable with .3.4a
and the CScript.  


Thanks for such a great program

I use Yajhfc as a windows client and its great.  I also like to put a
lot of notes/comments on my cover pages.  Often if I'm faxing a document
to someone,  rather than writing a separate cover letter for
instructions, etc, I like to use the fax cover sheet.  Yajhfc seems to
create forced word wrap that corresponds to the size of the send dialog
box.  On the final fax, this comments area ends up being a small column
that does not use the full page width.  Also, there seems to be a limit
as to how many lines of the comments will get transmitted, but no
indication that the comments have been truncated.

 

Any way we can get the cover page comments to only respond to /n (new
line) or word wrap at full page width?  And get a visual indicator that
the comments are too long?

 

Thanks,

Difficult (see explanation below).

&gt;<i> And get a visual indicator that 
</I>&gt;<i> the comments are too long?
</I>
Should be possible.

The YajHFC cover page code has been ported directly from the HylaFAX C++

client code, so that it may use the same PostScript cover page format
(this 
is not exactly required, however, as the HylaFAX server accepts any 
PostScript file as a cover page).

Unfortunately that code does all the word wrapping in PostScript and as
I 
don't know any PostScript it is quite difficult for me to change that 
behaviour.
What I know is that the code seems to wrap always after 35 characters
(not 
after a certain width) and that it supports a maximum of 9 lines of
text.
So a visual indicator about those limitations should be doable.

To be honest I am also a bit dissatisfied about the current cover page
support 
in YajHFC especially because there is no really user friendly cover page

designer out there.
On the other hand I don't want to spend a lot of time writing my own
cover 
page editor and I also don't know of any open source/freeware editor I
could 
use (if any reader knows one, please tell me!).

To make it short: 
Some visual indication will probably be implemented in the next version,
but 
a &quot;clean&quot; solution to the problem will probably take a bit longer.

Greetings,
Jonas
