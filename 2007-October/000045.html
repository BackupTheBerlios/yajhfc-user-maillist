&gt;<i> Sorry it took me a while to respond to this, but I couldn't remember all

</I>&gt;<i> I ran the 'windows setup' release (I think this actually has 3.3?).

No problem for me. It's better to wait a few days than to get &quot;incorrect&quot; 
feedback. ;-)

&gt;<i> And 
</I>&gt;<i> this bombed due to not being able to find a proper PS driver (Vista does
</I>&gt;<i> not come with the Apple Drivers ... go figure).  However, it did install
</I>&gt;<i> Redmon, and setup the Virtual Port.
</I>&gt;<i> I then copies the 3.5 jar into c:\Yajhfc as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> yajhfc-launch.vbs file.  I corrected all the paths and file names, setup
</I>&gt;<i> the redmon port to call cscripte.exe and pointed it at the VBS file and
</I>&gt;<i> it seems to be working just fine.  I think I am using an HP Laserjet 4
</I>&gt;<i> driver.

OK, fine. If the selection of the printer driver is the only problem with 
Vista, adding Vista support to the Setup should be pretty easy to do.
As I will probably get access to a Vista installation during the next few 
weeks, this might be done soon.

&gt;<i> So, I'll rescind my statement that 3.5 is broken.  Apparently I need to
</I>&gt;<i> dig a little deeper on my personal workstation, as on the fresh install
</I>&gt;<i> I did this weekend, it seems to have gone Ok, except for the initial
</I>&gt;<i> install problem of Apple drivers.
</I>
It is of course still perfectly possible that this is caused by problems in 
0.3.5 since I had to change the login code to add the progress bar (so 0.3.5 
*might* behave a bit different from 0.3.4a).
If you have any new findings please let me know.

Thanks again for your feedback,
Jonas
