&gt;<i> I use Yajhfc as a windows client and its great.  I also like to put a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of notes/comments on my cover pages.  Often if I'm faxing a document
</I>&gt;<i> to someone,  rather than writing a separate cover letter for
</I>&gt;<i> instructions, etc, I like to use the fax cover sheet.  Yajhfc seems to
</I>&gt;<i> create forced word wrap that corresponds to the size of the send dialog
</I>&gt;<i> box.  On the final fax, this comments area ends up being a small column
</I>&gt;<i> that does not use the full page width.  Also, there seems to be a limit
</I>&gt;<i> as to how many lines of the comments will get transmitted, but no
</I>&gt;<i> indication that the comments have been truncated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any way we can get the cover page comments to only respond to /n (new
</I>&gt;<i> line) or word wrap at full page width?
</I>
Difficult (see explanation below).

&gt;<i> And get a visual indicator that 
</I>&gt;<i> the comments are too long?
</I>
Should be possible.

The YajHFC cover page code has been ported directly from the HylaFAX C++ 
client code, so that it may use the same PostScript cover page format (this 
is not exactly required, however, as the HylaFAX server accepts any 
PostScript file as a cover page).

Unfortunately that code does all the word wrapping in PostScript and as I 
don't know any PostScript it is quite difficult for me to change that 
behaviour.
What I know is that the code seems to wrap always after 35 characters (not 
after a certain width) and that it supports a maximum of 9 lines of text.
So a visual indicator about those limitations should be doable.

To be honest I am also a bit dissatisfied about the current cover page support 
in YajHFC especially because there is no really user friendly cover page 
designer out there.
On the other hand I don't want to spend a lot of time writing my own cover 
page editor and I also don't know of any open source/freeware editor I could 
use (if any reader knows one, please tell me!).

To make it short: 
Some visual indication will probably be implemented in the next version, but 
a &quot;clean&quot; solution to the problem will probably take a bit longer.

Greetings,
Jonas
