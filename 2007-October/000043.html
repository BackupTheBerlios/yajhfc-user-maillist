&gt;<i> I have not looked at the code, nor do I have much experience with Java
</I>&gt;<i> (I do mostly Database stuff with Delphi).  However, based on the
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, I think the comments area is simply stored in an array.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think the word wrap is actually being done by the memo/edit control of
</I>&gt;<i> Java.  Thus, when the code passes the memo.lines[] array of strings to
</I>&gt;<i> the cover page code, it does not reformat them, just passes each line
</I>&gt;<i> un-modified.  This is probably the correct behavior.  As a test of my
</I>&gt;<i> theory, if the dialog box was resizable, and thus the memo control could
</I>&gt;<i> be made bigger, I expect each line would get appropriately longer.
</I>
Sorry, but I *know* for sure that the string I get from the &quot;memo&quot; (JTextArea) 
is not wrapped (at least when I output it to the console for testing).
You can confirm that behaviour by entering a line 
containing &quot;iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...&quot;  and another line 
containing &quot;WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW...&quot; into the comment area. On the screen 
much more i's than W's will fit in a line while on the cover page the number 
will be the same.

Making the dialog box resizable should be no problem and is a good idea, 
however.

&gt;<i> While on the subject of Cover pages, I would like to suggest a minor
</I>&gt;<i> change in the send dialog.  I am a big fan of producing interfaces that
</I>&gt;<i> are workable from the keyboard without having to go to the mouse unless
</I>&gt;<i> desired.  The two-tabbed approach breaks this for me.  If we could
</I>&gt;<i> combine these tabs into one larger dialog, or move the cover page stuff
</I>&gt;<i> to the front tab, and relegate the file input box and other options to
</I>&gt;<i> the second tab, I think it might flow better.  Of course, I almost only
</I>&gt;<i> use this from a --stdin perspective.  It may make more sense the way it
</I>&gt;<i> is if you do a lot of sending from files.  In that case, maybe a switch
</I>&gt;<i> internally that shows different dialogs for --stdin &amp; launching directly
</I>&gt;<i> from the UI?
</I>
I will think about it but I don't want to promise anything right now (you 
certainly have a point here...).

&gt;<i> Also,  I tried to use .3.5 and while it works from the UI, I cannot get
</I>&gt;<i> it to work from --stdin and Redmon.  I am using Vista, which has been
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to get to work at all, but I'm now pretty stable with .3.4a
</I>&gt;<i> and the CScript.
</I>
As I currently don't own a Vista copy for testing, could you tell some details 
about &quot;how&quot; 0.3.5 does not work in Vista (does it start, is the Send dialog 
shown, is there no data/is it corrupted, ...)?

BTW, did you have to use any &quot;special tricks&quot; (apart from using the 
yajhfc-launch.vbs script) to get 0.3.4a to work with Redmon on Vista?
If yes, could you maybe give a short description of what you had to do (to 
make life a bit easier for other users)?

Thanks again for your feedback,
Jonas
