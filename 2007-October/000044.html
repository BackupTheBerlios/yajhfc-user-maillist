<PRE>Sorry it took me a while to respond to this, but I couldn't remember all
the issues I had with my workstation.  I also knew that I was getting
ready to setup a new Vista station, so I wanted to do it 'from scratch'.
I ran the 'windows setup' release (I think this actually has 3.3?).  And
this bombed due to not being able to find a proper PS driver (Vista does
not come with the Apple Drivers ... go figure).  However, it did install
Redmon, and setup the Virtual Port.
I then copies the 3.5 jar into c:\Yajhfc as well as the
yajhfc-launch.vbs file.  I corrected all the paths and file names, setup
the redmon port to call cscripte.exe and pointed it at the VBS file and
it seems to be working just fine.  I think I am using an HP Laserjet 4
driver.

So, I'll rescind my statement that 3.5 is broken.  Apparently I need to
dig a little deeper on my personal workstation, as on the fresh install
I did this weekend, it seems to have gone Ok, except for the initial
install problem of Apple drivers.


&gt;<i>As I currently don't own a Vista copy for testing, could you tell some
</I>details 
&gt;<i>about &quot;how&quot; 0.3.5 does not work in Vista (does it start, is the Send
</I>dialog 
&gt;<i>shown, is there no data/is it corrupted, ...)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>BTW, did you have to use any &quot;special tricks&quot; (apart from using the 
</I>&gt;<i>yajhfc-launch.vbs script) to get 0.3.4a to work with Redmon on Vista?
</I>&gt;<i>If yes, could you maybe give a short description of what you had to do
</I>(to 
&gt;<i>make life a bit easier for other users)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks again for your feedback,
</I>&gt;<i>Jonas
