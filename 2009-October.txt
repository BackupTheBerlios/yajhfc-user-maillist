Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Search Date Problem
Message-ID: <4AD57C2F.3020706@2bsolutions.it>

Hi,
I've been test YajHFC, and I found that it's great.

But I not understand the SEARCH function by time/date. On table, date is 
display by dd/mm/yyyy, but if i put on search string 23/09/2009, the 
result is nothing.

I read the FAQ, said that the date is in a java SimpleDateFormat.

What is the corret string to put on search string for a corret date filter?

Thanks in advance

In which column you are trying to search?

Thanks,

Most likely the problem is that if you enter only a date internally a time of 
00:00:00 is assumed (so the date/time of faxes at the same date, but another 
time of day will not be considered equal to the date you entered).

To work around this problem, you can try searching with the "greater or equal" 
operator.

If it still does not work, please write me another mail.


Hope that helps
Jonas

OK, then I misunderstood you, sorry.

The search bar currently does not search for date/time. 
I will put extending it to do that on the "wishlist" for future feature 
enhancements.

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Icon Image Substitution
Message-ID: <4AD6D708.1090101@2bsolutions.it>

Hi Jonas,

I have another question.
I see on source code that the image is a part of a Java package.
Can I change to icon image ( Send Faxes, Phonebook, etc..), substituting 
the image mantaining the same file-name, without "break any license" 
(yours or Sun)?

Thanks in advance.

In my opinion replacing them should be no problem (I am not a lawyer, 
however...).

Message-ID: <4ADC7607.8040802@2bsolutions.it>

Hi Jonas,

I setup a JDBC connection for my phonebook that pick the field form a 
mysql database. Everythings goes fine, i setup the correct filed and the 
preview of fax is OK.
The problem appear when i  click the CLOSE button on phonebook windows 
WHEN the "Opening phone books... Loading" is prompt.
At this point, the phonebook DISAPPEAR fron the phonebook list, and it 
must be reload from stratch.

If i wait the connection, all works fine.

Thanks in advance.

This is a bug. It will be fixed in the next version.
