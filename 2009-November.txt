Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Questions about sorting faxes and printing to virtual
	printer
Message-ID: <1257062253.24556.173.camel@scarafaggio>

Hi all,
I am new to yajhfc, so I do have a few questions about usability.

It seems all faxes are initially sorted by their job id, but user may
always change the sorted column or direction clicking on the column
title. My question is: how do I change default ordering, or how do I
tell the system to remember my current sort preference?

Another question (it might be a bug) is about the fax printer and its
cscript invoked visual basic command. I noticed that it only works when
yajhfc is running. When the client is not opened, i.e., its icon is
missing from Windows tray, and user print on the fax printer, the client
is started, a window for fax details is opened, but then, when user
press Send, it stop working. Is this the intended behaviour?

Thanks,
Giuseppe

Hello,

thanks for your bug report!

Normally the last ordering should be saved when you quit the program.

Saving settings when the user logs off is always a bit problematic, however 
(due to a bug in Java itself).
Did you try if the ordering is saved when you exit the program by Fax -> Quit?

This is not the intended behaviour. The program should keep running after the 
fax has been sent.
In what respect does YajHFC stop working? Is the main window not visible any 
more, do you get an error message, does it stop responding, etc.?

Thanks,
Jonas.

Hello Jonas,

One of my users would like to print his phonebooks (and he's got some :) 
), I'm wondering if you can give me some hints about how can I do that...
What I've done 'till now:
modified NewPhoneBookWin, imported print functions, create a new action 
called listActionPrint, create a menu entry for listActionPrint  
(replicating the "Remove from list") and I'm pretty stuck in defining 
the printing function. I thaught that I can duplicate somehow the "print 
table" one, from the MainWin - well... WRONG! It's not the same thing at 
all, so please, help a guy who said "YES, WE CAN DO IT" way to fast! :)

I just trying version: yajhfc-0_4_2a.jar and all I can say WOW!
This is the best client for Hylafax I've tested so far on Linux.  The installation was super easy.

1.) Though I think there is a bug with Cover Page. I sent 1-page fax + cover page when I received the fax the cover page said:
Pages: 12

I think that should be "2"

2.) Search by date doesn't work

Well, I don't think there is an easy, quick and clean way to do that.

A quick and dirty workaround (untested) could be to load the phone book into a 
JTable using a PhoneBookTableModel and then printing that table like the one 
in MainWin. 
I think this should work without adding the JTable to a window, but I'm not 
sure about that.

Hope that helps
Jonas

Yes. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce that problem here (i.e. I see "2" here).
With which kind of files have you tried that? (Or even better: Could you send 
me an example file that gives you "12" here?)

The date parse function is quite picky about the format (as I still use the 
stock Java one -- changing it to something more user friendly is already on 
the list of things to do...).
That means you will have to enter both date and time for a search value to be 
accepted (e.g. something like "11/13/2009 00:00:00").


Hope that helps

Jonas

I am currently using yajhfc 0.4.2.a with Hylafax 6.0.3 on Cent 0s 5.4 .

In the default view in yajhfc the error column is always showen but no
information ever get reported in yajhfc even through we do get faxes with
error's in like partial faxes etc.

Do I need to set up something for this to work, or this something that needs
fixing in yajhfc?

This information is being stored by hylafax in the xferfaxlog log files on
the server.

Thanks

Andy

Yes, you are right: ordering settings are correctly saved and restored
automatically.

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Number of pages seems wrong when forwarding received

Message-ID: <1259230397.5764.37.camel@scarafaggio>

Hi,
I am trying to understand if what we are facing is a problem in our
installation or if it is a generalised bug. What happen is that the
number of pages, as displayed in cover page, is always zero when
forwarding faxes. If we send a fax using a PDF or TIFF file, this number
is correctly computer, while if this is a received fax (still stored in
hylafax) the same number is always zero.

Does anyone have the same problem?

Thanks,
Giuseppe

I guess everyone has this problem. ;-)

When forwarding an existing fax currently the number of pages is not counted 
(basically this is an oversight...).
I will add this functionality in one of the next releases.

I tested this today and this seems to be a HylaFAX problem.

When I set the RcvFmt to "%-7m %4p%1z %-8.8o %14.14s %7t %f %e" for faxstat 
and did a "faxstat -r" the error information was not shown either.

A look at the HylaFAX source code (V 4.4.4) seems to confirm this: 
All information from the received queue is read from the TIFF header of the 
individual TIFF files in the recvq. For me it looks like the error field is 
never filled there (tiffinfo also does not show such information).


So there is probably not much I can do about that (except hiding the error 
column in the default view...).
