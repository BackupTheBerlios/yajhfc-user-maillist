The archive view completely bypasses the HylaFAX server and uses the file 
system directly (theoretically it would work without even connecting to 
HylaFAX). 
Because of that the only permissions taking effect are the &quot;normal&quot; file 
permissions on the server -- so it is no bug when the admin mode does not 
change anything here.

Nevertheless it is a bit odd that you can only view faxes sent by yourself (as 
long as &quot;View-&gt;Only own faxes&quot; is *not* checked, of course ;-) ).
Most likely this is a permission problem, but it also might be a bug in YajHFC 
(because the archive code has not been tested very much so far).

You can check for a permission problem by browsing the archive directory with 
a file manager on the client and trying if you can open the &quot;qX&quot; files inside 
the sub directories of the archive directory (where X is the name of the sub 
directory).

For example, if you cannot see job 123, check if you can 
open &quot;archive/123/q123&quot; with a text editor. 
If you can read this file on the client, but YajHFC does not show that job, 
this is a bug in YajHFC.

Similarly you can check if deleting jobs fails due to a bug in YajHFC or due 
to a permission problem: If you can delete the subdirectory belonging to the 
job with a file manager, but not with YajHFC, it is a bug. 

For example, if YajHFC cannot delete job 123, check if you can remove the 
directory &quot;archive/123&quot;.

Jonas
