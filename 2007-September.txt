New features/changes:
- Some UI improvements/"polishing" (e.g. progress bar for the fax list and 
more icons)
- Removed some restrictions on visible columns 
  (e.g.: the job ID does no longer have to be visible)
- New fax actions now are executed only *after* the faxes are no longer "in 
progress"
