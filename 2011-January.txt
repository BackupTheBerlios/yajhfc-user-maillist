Subject: [Yajhfc-user] YajHFC 0.5.0beta2
Message-ID: <201101091434.07132.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

A new beta version for YajHFC 0.5.0 has been made available today.

You can find it in the following directory:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/beta/

In addition to the previous beta (for details see 
http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yajhfc-announce/2010/000032.html ), this 
version incorporates the following changes:

- Support for multiple servers

- Support for multiple identities


Since both are rather large changes at the "core" of the program, this beta 
might contain all kinds of new bugs (i.e. you should not use in in a 
production environment without a thorough test).

Nevertheless, everybody is encouraged to test this new version and report any 
bugs, possible improvements, etc. he or she finds.
(BTW, if you find it stable enough for production use in your environment, a 
short notice would be nice, too...).

Happy testing!

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] 0.5.0beta5: connection refused
Message-ID: <201101281722.02708.lists@egidy.de>

Hi,

I tried 0.5.0beta5 on Windows XP and Windows 7 today. When I had a 0.4.4 
installed and configured on the machine before, the 0.5.0beta5 works fine.

But if 0.5.0beta5 is the first YajHFC you ever install on an account, I see 
the following problem:

- Configuring a fax server works fine.
- The connection test button in the configure menu works fine and tells me 
that the connection is working
- As soon as the rest of the program tries to use this connection to e.g. 
check the fax queues, I get a connection refused error:

java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect

YajHFC 0.5.0beta5
Java 1.6.0_21 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.6.0_21-b07
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
Windows XP 5.1 (x86)

When looking at the server logs or a tcpdump on the server, I don't see the 
client trying to connect.

So to me it seems like the new connection dialogue is storing the connection 
settings in a way the rest of the program does not accept. When there are 
still connection settings available from an older version, they are used just 
fine.

I was looking for a program replacing the old WHFC on machines that are 
upgraded to Win 7. Aside from this issue with the beta version, the 0.4.4 does 
a very good job as fax client. Especially the windows installer which does all 
the work and creates a fax printer etc. is good as our customers won't have 
problems with installing anymore.

Kind regards,

Gerd

Thank you very much for testing the beta!

I uploaded a new version (0.5.0beta6) to ftp.berlios.de, which should fix the 
bug you described above.


Best regards

Thanks for the quick fix. I can confirm that it works for me now as expected.

Kind regards,
