Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Filter incoming faxes by device
Message-ID: <14999543.3369281290139521475.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi,I have 8 analog modem (diva) and I have bound each line  with a specific modem.In this way I can define from which or them to make a call and it works fine. Furthermore there is a field in sent tab where I can see which of them has been used.
I would like to know if there is a way to view only incoming faxes filtered by modem.
There is no field 'modem' in received tab where I can read from which of them a fax is received, although there is a DEVICE variable in Hylafax log that contains the correct  value of this device when a fax is received
It would  be nice to filter received faxes simply adding a field 'modem'. Now I filter by CID Number and it works fine but the configuration take more time.
 
I'm tired  now. Sorry for my English.
Pasquale

This feature has been wished for before, but it is quite hard to implement:

As far as I know, HylaFAX offers no direct way for a client using the HylaFAX 
protocol to get the information on which modem a fax has been received.

Also, it is not possible to get the contents of the log (this would only be 
possible by using a separate connection with another protocol (i.e. by using 
Samba, FTP, HTTP ... to make that file available)).

Thank you very much.
I didn'know about Hylafax protocol issue. I'm sorry.
So, it would be better ask to Lee :-) .
