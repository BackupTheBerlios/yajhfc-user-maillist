Thanks for the log!
It seems that you use tiff2pdf.exe directly which often does not work 
(tiff2pdf crashes) on Windows Vista and Windows 7, most probably due to a bug 
in tiff2pdf.

Please download the following batch file and place it in the directory where 
tiff2pdf.exe is:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/tiff2pdf.cmd

Then, configure YajHFC to use tiff2pdf.cmd instead of tiff2pdf.exe and try 
again.


Thanks
Jonas

Hi,

 

I installed hylafax on a server, i can send and receive faxes.

In YajHFC, the list 'received' is empty. I can send faxes with the
faxprinter

OS client = windows vista

OS server = ubuntu server 10.04

 

Where to look?

I would first look on the server:

Try if "faxstat -r" lists any faxes.
If it does not, it is most likely some configuration issue with HylaFAX; if it 
lists faxes, it can be a problem with YajHFC.

If faxstat -r does not work, it might be helpful to take a look at any 
additional software you use to access HylaFAX: 
Often such software moves the faxes to their own storage (which usually is 
more efficient than HylaFAX's) which makes them inaccessible by YajHFC.


Hope that helps
Jonas

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Windows setup misdetects java on win7 64bit
Message-ID: <20100815111937.B8656F825@i3.golden.dom>

I have a new system with win7 64bit.
Java is java 32 bit 6u21, java.com tells me I have java installed.
Using yajhfc-0_4_4rc1-setup.exe

1)
When I launch YajHFC setup it tells me that YajHFC needs an installed java
runtime environment, asks me if I want to download it or continue w/o being
able to use the program.
It seems it doesn't properly detect that java is installed in	
c:\program files (x86)\java

2)
I select "no" (continue w/o downloading java), and select to download and
install tiff2pdf.

3)
The install completes succesfully, but I'm asked to reboot.
I don't remember being asked to reboot when using winxp 32bit, is this
normal? What is causing the need for a reboot?

4)
I went on without rebooting. YajHFC started correctly and I could adjust the
settings and then send a fax (I had to try 3 times before the "send fax"
window appeared, the 1st 2 times I could just see the cscript dos box, and
the "send fax"windows appeared only after I clicked on the icon in the
notification area; after that it seems it stabilized and the window comes up
ok).
The fax completed succesfully.

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Batch fax
Message-ID: <A0E17F449AB1428882EC0E98C5B5D894@JosKantoor>

Hi,
 
When sending a batch of about 200 faxes, a lot of faxes fail with "kill time
expired".
I assume the 'kill time' setting in yajhc (send window) is 'cancel job after
(minutes)'
It won't allow a 'kill time' longer then 180 minutes. Sending 200 faxes with
1 modem takes a lot longer.
 
How can I set a longer 'kill-time' when sending a fax?
 
Thanks,
Jos

You should be able to set up to 2000 minutes in the current version.

Or can you set that value and it does not work?

This should be fixed in the newest setup.exe from
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/0.4.4rc

Usually the setup requests a reboot only if it could not overwrite some files 
because another program was using them.

Strange... 
Maybe it had something to do with the missing reboot... (?)
