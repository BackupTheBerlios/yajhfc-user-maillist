Subject: [Yajhfc-user] YajHFC command line only mode
Message-ID: <201106201447.32467.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

Hello,

due to "public demand", I created (kind of) an addon to YajHFC which supports 
command line only operation without a graphical user interface.

You can download it from:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-console.zip

It is still an early beta and has not got much testing, so you should probably 
not use it in production yet.

If you are interested in such a operation mode, please test this version and 
let me know about all bugs (or important missing features) you find.

Have fun,
Jonas Wolz
