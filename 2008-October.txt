Subject: [Yajhfc-user] yajhfc client logging loading without end / jar file

Message-ID: <48E3499E.7050803@smtech.it>

Hi, I hope you can help me. I've got a lan network with some mac 
computers running yajhfc fax client. Yesterday i've installed in a new 
client the yajhfc, i put the settings and everything worked fine. But 
today nothing work, when you start the jar file it remains in logging, 
and you have to force the closing.

In another mac running osx 10.3.9 the JAR file doesn't start at all. 
I've updated java and everything that yajhfc needs but nothing.

Thanks

Is this the same version that already works on the other clients?

And, can you send me some debug log files for the clients that don't work?

To create such a log file, you'll have to run YajHFC with the additional 
command line parameters "--debug --logfile=:prompt:".
To do so, you can open a terminal, change to the directory where yajhfc.jar is 
located and run "java -jar yajhfc.jar --debug --logfile=:prompt:".
(Unfortunately, because I don't own a Mac myself, I cannot give more specific 
instructions...)

Without the log file I can only guess that the problem is probably some  
uncaught Exception, but as I don't know where it exactly happens, it is very 
hard to fix it for me.


Thanks,
Jonas

Now that I have the log file, I identified the cause of the problem:
The "location" of the recipient contains a new line character.
This confuses the gnu-hylafax library (but not HylaFAX itself) and causes the 
erroneous behaviour you experienced.

I included a workaround for that problem in YajHFC (new line characters are 
replaced with spaces before submitting data to the HylaFAX server).

You can get an updated "developer build" including this fix from:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc.jar

(Or wait for the next release, of course.)

Jonas

Hi, and thanks for the answer. The version we're using on the other mac 
client is this: yajhfc-0_3_6.jar
For the first case I wrote, i will try to make a log file with this syntax

"java -jar yajhfc.jar --debug --logfile=:prompt:" 

We tried more newer version but nothing change.
For the other mac with osx 10.3.9 it seems to be a problem with Java, 
i'll paste the console log
Thanks again.

Yes, that means that the version of Java is too old (below 1.5); to find out 
which version is actually used, you can type "java -version" in the Terminal.

The obvious fix is to install Java 1.5 or greater. ;-)

If you have already installed such a version of Java, there is probably some 
issue with your path or configuration which leads to the older version of 
Java to be used in preference.

If you know the location where that version has been installed, you can also 
try using the full path instead (e.g. "/opt/java1.5/bin/java -jar yajhfc.jar" 
instead of "java -jar yajhfc.jar" if Java has been installed 
to /opt/java1.5).


Hope that helps,
Jonas

Ah, I see there is some confusion with paths. OK, let's trace:
javaexe = C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_07\bin/java.exe
homedrv = Z:
homedir = \
userprofile = Z:\
env("USERPROFILE") = userprofile = Z:\

BTW, the following gets variables wrong:
' Fix temp dir
env("TMP") = WshShell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(wshshell.regread("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\TMP"))
env("TEMP") = WshShell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(wshshell.regread("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\TEMP"))

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\TEMP=%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp=Z:\Local Settings\Temp
which is wrong, as there is no such directory and actual TEMP in good (not changed)
environment is TEMP=C:\DOCUME~1\USERNA~1\LOCALS~1\Temp, while
USERPROFILE=C:\Documents and Settings\username

So it seems there was no need to set TEMP and USERPROFILE, the values in environment were ok.

OK, so I just replace line
' Launch java:
Set java = WshShell.Exec(javaexe & " -Duser.home=""" & userprofile & """ " & yjargs)

with

Set java = WshShell.Exec(javaexe & " " & yjargs)

and it starts to work. But, if YajHFC is not running, it starts and hangs on Fetching fax list
(it's a different problem, I saw it before on another PC) with empty log file
(only env variables in it), or the YajHFC main window is opened and freezes,
then log file is:

Error #-2147024664: 
2008.10.21 03.36.27 yajhfc.Launcher main

Send fax dialog is opened correctly if YajHFC is running before I try to print a fax test page.

Did you take the values of the environment variables from the printlaunch.vbs 
environment when it is invoked by Redmon?

The problem and the reason for all that "environment fixup" is, that when a 
program is invoked by Redmon as user, it often (but not always!) still 
inherits the environment from Redmon, i.e. USERPROFILE="C:\Documents and 
Settings\LocalService" and TEMP=TMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP.
I am asking this because the Redmon log in your last mail also showed those 
symptoms when looking at the environment dump.

It would be nice if you could try if printlaunch.vbs from 
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/printlaunch.vbs still has the same 
problems with the incorrect enviroment fixup (it incorporates a workaround 
suggested by another user to detect if the path specified by HOMEDRIVE and 
HOMEPATH is valid).

Could you create a YajHFC debug log file for that case?

To do so, please modify the registry value 
at "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\yajhfc\printlaunchparams" to something like 
'-jar "c:\program files\yajhfc\yajhfc.jar" --stdin --debug 
--logfile=c:\yajhfc.log' 
(i.e. add the command line parameters --debug and --logfile and 
remove --background; of course you can use a different log file location).
Then, please try printing again and send me both the YajHFC and the Redmon 
log.

Thanks,
Jonas

Frankly: I don't know (as I don't use the CVS versions myself).

The reason for the problem probably is that the date/time representation of 
HylaFAX changed, so YajHFC can not parse it any more. 
But I do not know if this is just a temporary change/bug or permanent.

If it is permanent, I will add some special handling for the new format, but 
before I do that I would like to wait until HylaFAX 4.5 has at least reached 
official beta or release candidate state (to be sure the change really is 
permanent).

Nevertheless, thank you very much for the hint!

Jonas

Hi Jonas

Thanks for the reply, It was not really a hint (Honestly) but an
observation that I spotted with this new CVS version which I have been
seeing this ovservation since around July.

Thanks

Andy

No, from a user environment.

It is the case here, as you can see from redmon log in my first post.

But why passing -Duser.home to java.exe is needed? For local address book
(which I don't use btw, i use a jdbc one) only?

I get an Error - Could not determine User Profile Path. Cancelling YajHFC launch.

I changed to Set java = WshShell.Exec(javaexe & " -Duser.home=" & userprofile & " " & yjargs)

It tries to get settings from Z:\.yajhfc\settings, but they are in
C:\Documents and Settings\username\.yajhfc, so using -Duser.home=homedrv & homedir (Z:\)
is probably not a good idea.

To answer myself - for settings. When a good -Duser.home is passed, there are
no hangs and I get send fax dialog even if yajhfc is not started before printing.

Some good news. wshNet.UserDomain is empty (probably because the script is run
as local service), and because of this the "hard way" of getting the user profile fails.
If I run printlaunch.vbs manually, I can see wshNet.UserDomain is correct, but if I
run from redmon it is empty. Everything works if I hardcode domain in the line
Set Account = WMIService.Get("Win32_UserAccount.Name='" & WshNet.UserName & "',Domain='" & 
wshNet.UserDomain & "'")
Now I need to find out how to get the domain name when the script is run from redmon...

Nerijus

I added between lines "userprofile = WshShell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings..." and "else"
the following code, and now everything works:

	if (IsEmpty(userprofile)) then
	    ' Probably domain name was empty, try to find it in registry
	    Set Account = WMIService.Get("Win32_UserAccount.Name='" & WshNet.UserName & "',Domain='" & 
wshshell.regread("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\CachePrimaryDomain") & 
"'")

	    userprofile = 
WshShell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(WshShell.RegRead("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows 
NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\" + Account.SID + "\ProfileImagePath"))
	end if

Nice, thank you very much for your efforts to find a fix for this problem! 
I will integrate this fix into the next version of YajHFC.

BTW, now I found the missing quotes from the launch command line:
> C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_07\bin\java.exe -Duser.home="Z:\" -jar
> "C:\Program Files\YajHFC\yajhfc.jar" --stdin --debug

The quotes around "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_07\bin\java.exe" are missing 
here (sorry for that; unfortunately I did not find these forgotten quotes by 
testing because I only have German language versions of Windows XP available 
here, where "C:\Program Files" is called "C:\Programme" (without any space)).

Also answering myself here ;-)
If somebody has the same problems before the next version is released, an 
updated version of printlaunch.vbs can be found at:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/printlaunch.vbs
