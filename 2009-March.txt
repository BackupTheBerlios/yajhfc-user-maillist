Windows setup.exe: 
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_4_0-setup.exe

New features/changes compared to 0.4.0beta:
- Greek translation added
- Support to manually answer a phone call (similar to faxanswer)

Hello,

When I first launched YajHFC on Linux, kfax was set as "Command line for fax viewer"
option. I suggest to replace it with okular - see here for more info:

I will consider this for future versions.

In current versions (beginning with 0.3.7, I think) this should not be much of 
an issue, however, because the default viewer is set to "kfmclient exec %s" 
if YajHFC is started in KDE or "gnome-open %s" if it is started in GNOME.
kfax/gv is only used as a fallback when neither KDE nor GNOME can be detected.


Thanks for the feedback,
Jonas

Hello,

first lets congratulate for this great client, i really love it. But there is one problem for me now, i can't get it working
under Windows 2003. Using it on my Workstation with XP runs fine.

I installed it under Win2k3, installation went fine, the client opens when you run it manually without problems. But when
i try to print for example a testpage to the printer nothing happens, the send dialog just won't open, no error messages.

Does anybody already have this running? Perhaps there are some adjustements need in the printlaunch.vbs? 

Hopefully someone can help!

Regards,
Christian Metzen

Does the printlaunch.vbs script start when you print to the YajHFC printer? 
(i.e. can you see a console window in the taskbar for a short time?)

In any case, please enable the Redmon log file in order to capture any error 
messages that may be printed by the script and then send that log file to me 
(I do not have Win2k3 here, so I cannot test YajHFC with it myself).

To enable that log file, go to the properties of the YajHFC printer, select 
the "Ports" tab, select the "YAJHFC:" port, click "Configure", click the "Log 
file" button and check the "Use Log File" check box.

After enabling the log file, I would suggest to also uncomment the last two 
lines in printlaunch.vbs to capture error messages printed by Java or YajHFC.
I.e., change these last two lines to:
wscript.stdout.write java.stdout.readAll()
wscript.stderr.write java.stderr.readAll()


Thanks,
Jonas

Hello,

 

I'm using JBDC connection with MySQL database in  order to centralize
read/unread indicator and it functions fine.

I've customized a filter "CIDNumber equals to ...."and after that I've
seen only filtered faxes as expected but when I'm going to open unread
fax an error comes up.

 

The user can see the fax but he must close the windows with error
message every time (it's a little bit fastidious).

 

This message occurs every first time I'm opening unread faxes and also
when I'm forcing the fax as unread.

This is a bug in YajHFC. It has an effect whenever you apply a filter to the 
list of received faxes. 
Apart from the error message, the only effect of this bug probably is that the 
number of unread faxes shown in the tray icon's tooltip is wrong.

It should now be fixed in the current developer version 
(ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc.jar ; this version might contain 
other bugs, however).

Thanks for the bug report,
Jonas

Hi,

i think i figured out the problem. Redmon doesn't work under W2K3 
Terminalserver because the security restriction are in charge.

You get a error "createprocessasuser failed error code 87"

A solution would be using RedmonEE instead, but i can't get it to run 
with yajhfc. Any ideas, or could you perhaps integrate RedmonEE in your 
setup?

Regards,
Christian

I think I have found a way to manually create a fax printer with YajHFC and 
RedmonEE (but tested it only with WinXP SP3, so I do not know if it works 
with W2K3).

Please download ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/redmonee.zip and read the 
file "install.html" in that archive for a (very) short guide on how to do 
that (it would be nice if you could give me a short feedback if it worked for 
you or if you still have problems).

The basic idea for using RedmonEE with YajHFC is as follows:
You can't directly run a GUI application that receives the printed data with 
RedmonEE as you can do with Redmon. So you have to save that data in a 
temporary file first (which is accomplished by savein.vbs).
Then, you can use the ability of RedmonEE to start an application after the 
job has been printed to invoke YajHFC (using execyajhfc.vbs).

Currently this approach still has the problem that the temporary file will get 
overwritten if the same user prints to the fax printer while the YajHFC send 
dialog is still open (because the file's content will copied to the server 
only after the user clicked on "Send").
This is probably solvable, but requires some more work on my side.

I can not promise when/if RedmonEE will be integrated into the setup, but I 
will consider it for one of the next releases (probably only as an option, 
not as default (except for Windows Server OSes)).

Hope that helps,
Jonas
