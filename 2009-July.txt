Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Feature Request
Message-ID: <4A647C4E.8020901@lauserco.com>

Hello,
First I want to thank the author for this software, we are using it for 
about 1 yr now and we are extremely happy with it!
 Our setup includes one hylafax+ server with mainly windows clients 
(deployed automatically with tiff2ps, gs and yajhfc2pdf script by Thomas 
Koch), a few linux ones and occasionally macs. The cover pages in .ps 
format resides on the server. We also have a small script that takes a 
.csv file and transforms it to a .phonebook and that too works just fine.

Now, the sales dept came with the brilliant idea of using a kind of 
watermark on the sent faxes and I have no clue where should I start 
from. Has anyone tried to implement something like that and is willing 
to share? Thank you.

Best Regards,
Sorin Toma

Just an untested idea:
AFAIK you can use pdftk to add watermarks to PDFs 
(http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/; should be available as package for most 
Linux distribution).

HylaFAX uses the bin/pdf2fax and bin/ps2fax 
(e.g. /var/spool/hylafax/bin/pdf2fax) scripts to convert PS or PDF to TIFF.
So you could create a wrapper script around the original scripts which adds 
the watermark and then passes the modified file to the original script.

The advantage of this is that it does not need any changes to the client, but 
the user will not see the water mark when he views sent faxes.


If it is required to see the watermark, I think this must be done on the 
client before the PDF or PS is sent to the server. 
Unfortunately this is currently not possible with YajHFC (it would be 
necessary to call a "filter script" before sending a document which is 
currently not possible).

Hope that helps,
Jonas

That's what I' working at, right now I am already able to add text 
watermarks but...

Another big drawback is that it is adding the watermark to the 
cover-page also.

Yes, well, but you put in the client the option to send all the jobs as 
PS/PDF/TIFF - isn't that alredy a kind "filter" (I did not looked 
further - the server-side processing seemed easier for me and I started 
on that path)?
Anyway, it is not a "must", or a "can't live without it" feature, but 
more in the area of "nice to have" :)

Thank you, and again THANK YOU for developing Yajhfc, it's a great 
little piece of software :)

Yes, it is similar, but not the same.
The current conversion runs only when necessary and both when sending and 
viewing faxes.
Implementing such a filter would probably not be that difficult, but I also 
classify this as "nice to have", so this does not have a very high priority 
for me.
