Subject: [Yajhfc-user] 0.5.0beta7: can't delete server configurations
Message-ID: <201103040920.54558.lists@egidy.de>

Hi,

I was playing around with the 0.5.0b7 a bit and stumbled upon a problem when 
trying to delete a server configuration. You can reproduce it like this:

- install yajhfc
- set up the "standard" server config to make it work
- close the options dialog
- open the options dialog
- add a new server config
- configure this server config to make it work
- close the options dialog
- open the options dialog
- go to the list of server configs
- delete the first "standard" one
- click on the second one you created
- click on edit (or whatever that is called in your language)
-> you see the options of the "standard" server config which should have been 
deleted but is still there

Also the tree view on the left side of the options dialog still shows the old 
config too.

Kind regards,

Gerd

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] YajHFC 0.5.0 release candiate
Message-ID: <201103131325.43327.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

In a few weeks YajHFC 0.5.0 will be released.

You can download the current release candidate as jar file / Windows setup / 
Linux packages / MAC app from:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/beta/

The translations (except German) are still incomplete, but they will be 
updated as soon as they are ready.

Changes in YajHFC 0.5.0:
- Support for local caching of the fax lists, probably making the start-up of 
the application feel much quicker
- Experimental support for direct reading to the recvq and doneq directory, 
bypassing the HylaFAX server (and the HylaFAX user authentication). This 
might lead to a lower server load with large queues since only modified files 
are read to refresh the fax lists. This still needs some testing, however... 
(any feedback on this feature is very welcome!)
- Options dialog should open a bit faster than before
- "Test connection" button in the Options dialog
- Support for multiple servers
- Support for multiple identities
- Lists of faxes can be saved in CSV, HTML or XML format
- Support for configurable keyboard accelerators


If you find any bugs / problems / ... with this version, please let me know.

Have fun and thanks in advance for your feedback!

Jonas Wolz.

Hi!

I haven't tried this release yet but I would like to know what "Support for multiple servers" means exactly.

Is there any way of telling yajhfc to automatically resend a failed fax job to "the next server on the list"?

Maybe this could be done at server level only (ie. hylafax server 1 can pass the failed fax job to hylafax server 2, OR hylafax server 1 can try to use hylafax server 2's modems via TCP/IP) but I haven't managed to do it for now.

So I'm wondering if YajHFC 0.5.0 can re-send a failed job sequentially to its list of multiple servers. If the last server on the list also fails then abort.

Thanks

Vieri

Message-ID: <99504936-B675-4EF0-81CC-2E7D2301E14A@midstateconstruction.com>

Hello,
Thank you very much for YajHFC. Over the past week, we've sent roughly 3,300~ faxes. 

This leads me to my problem: When I send large batches of faxes, I can't easily correlate the entry with a batch. I can specify jobinfo via send fax>advanced>job properties, but I am unable to add a jobinfo column to the 'Sent' queue-view.

I want to be able to see groups of faxes with the same "subject line" in "Sent" queue-view.

Example:
If I send BatchA to 300 users and then send BatchB to 300 users, the queue-view will show 600 faxes. I cannot easily see which 300 were BatchA and which were BatchB.

Thanks for your help!

What have you tried to accomplish this?
Have you added the "tag string" column to the sent faxes?

I have tag string column enabled, it usually shows 'null'

I just sent a fax using send fax>advanced>job properties>
Key:TAGLINE
Value:Test

...and the tag string column shows 'null'

I attempted to send a 2nd test with:
Key:TAGSTRING

...and received the message 	
500 JPARM TAGSTRING: Parameter not recognized.

What job property key/value should I use? I've tried JOBINFO, JOBTAG & GROUPID

The HylaFAX jparm name is USRKEY.

But you actually do not need to use the advanced job properties for that:
YajHFC automatically sets the "Tag string" to the fax's "subject" as entered 
in the send dialog.

Hope that helps
Jonas

It means that you can add connection profiles for multiple servers (or 
multiple users on the same server).

No, version 0.5.0 cannot do this. 
This would not be that easy to do anyway, since a client does not get any 
explicit success/failure information from the server. So the only method to 
detect a failure would be scanning the sent/transmitting tables for failed 
faxes and then cancel them on server 1 and create a new job on server 2.
To be honest it is quite unlikely this will be implemented any time soon...

Message-ID: <imenj2$2ncf$1@hairball.ziemba.us>

First I'd like to thank Jonas (et al.?) for this software. It seems to
have a lot of nice features and I am happy to have found it.

I can send faxes but there are some little problems. I am not
experienced with Java (most of my work has been in C/C++) so I am not
sure how to classify some of these issues (are they problems in the
java environment external to yajhfc or are they internal to yajhfc?).

Should I open a bug in the tracker for either of these?

Thanks for your patience.

My setup:

OS: FreeBSD 8.2-PRERELEASE Sun Jan 23 00:28:46 PST 2011
Java: diablo-jdk1.6.0
yajhfc: 0.5.0rc5

1. Date/time of day on cover sheet is always in UTC timezone. In
   Extras>Options>Servers>Default there are Settings for "Date/Time
   offset" and "Time Zone" (the latter has choices Local and GMT)
   but neither has any effect on the cover sheet.

   How can I get correct date/time to appear on the cover sheet?


2. I get the following message at startup but I don't know what it means.
   It does not seem to affect functionality.

These settings only affect the date/times from the HylaFAX server, not the 
ones on the cover page.

The date/time on the cover page is generated by YajHFC and uses the local 
system time with the local time zone.
Currently there is no feature to change the time zone for the cover page.

Most likely your time zone is either not set correctly or (more likely) Java 
somehow does not recognize it...

libsplashscreen.so is a component of the Java runtime environment. This error 
probably means that this file has been linked against a different, 
incompatible version of some other library on your system (which in turn 
suggests that your Java installation is probably partially broken...).

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Status of YajHFC 0.5.0 translations
Message-ID: <201103271322.26245.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

Hello translators and users,

the release of YajHFC 0.5.0 is planned for the next weekend, some translations 
are still incomplete however.

This affects the following translations:

Greek:
521 translated messages, 2 fuzzy translations, 386 untranslated messages.
----------
Polish:
770 translated messages, 139 untranslated messages.
----------
Turkish:
725 translated messages, 184 untranslated messages.
----------

The rest of the translations (Chinese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, 
Russian) are complete (thanks to all translators here!).


If the Greek, Polish and Turkish translation are not completed before next 
weekend, I will release the program with incomplete translations for these 
languages.

Before doing so, however, I would like to ask the "general public" if there 
are any active users of these translations, who are willing to complete them 
for this and possibly future releases.

If yes, please send me a mail and I will provide you with instructions how to 
do the translation (even you need more than a week time for it; I will then 
decide if the release will be postponed because of that or not...).


Thanks in advance
Jonas Wolz

Aha. That was useful information. Indeed, my java installation didn't
seem to know the correct local timezone (even though everything else
on my system does). An updated version of /etc/localtime (previous was
from 2007) fixed that.

Hmm. At least now I know where to begin digging.
