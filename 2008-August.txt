New features/changes:
- New simplified send dialog
- Support for cover pages in HTML format
- Support for cover pages in XSL:FO and ODT format using a plugin
- Better plugin support
- Logging changed to use the Java logging APIs
- Now uses gnu.hylafax 1.0.1
- Some bug fixes

As mentioned above, YajHFC now supports cover pages in XSL:FO and OpenDocument 
Text format. Because the required libraries are rather large (11MB), a 
separate distribution/plugin including this support has been created.

You can download this plugin from the following locations:
General distribution (cross-platform, already includes YajHFC):
