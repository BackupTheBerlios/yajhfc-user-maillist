<PRE>Hi,I have 8 analog modem (diva) and I have bound each line  with a specific modem.In this way I can define from which or them to make a call and it works fine. Furthermore there is a field in sent tab where I can see which of them has been used.
I would like to know if there is a way to view only incoming faxes filtered by modem.
There is no field 'modem' in received tab where I can read from which of them a fax is received, although there is a DEVICE variable in Hylafax log that contains the correct  value of this device when a fax is received
It would  be nice to filter received faxes simply adding a field 'modem'. Now I filter by CID Number and it works fine but the configuration take more time.
 
I'm tired  now. Sorry for my English.
Pasquale
