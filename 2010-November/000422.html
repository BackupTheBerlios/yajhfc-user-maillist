&gt;<i> Hi,I have 8 analog modem (diva) and I have bound each line  with a specific
</I>&gt;<i> modem.In this way I can define from which or them to make a call and it
</I>&gt;<i> works fine. Furthermore there is a field in sent tab where I can see which
</I>&gt;<i> of them has been used. I would like to know if there is a way to view only
</I>&gt;<i> incoming faxes filtered by modem. There is no field 'modem' in received tab
</I>&gt;<i> where I can read from which of them a fax is received, although there is a
</I>&gt;<i> DEVICE variable in Hylafax log that contains the correct  value of this
</I>&gt;<i> device when a fax is received It would  be nice to filter received faxes
</I>&gt;<i> simply adding a field 'modem'. Now I filter by CID Number and it works fine
</I>&gt;<i> but the configuration take more time.
</I>
This feature has been wished for before, but it is quite hard to implement:

As far as I know, HylaFAX offers no direct way for a client using the HylaFAX 
protocol to get the information on which modem a fax has been received.

Also, it is not possible to get the contents of the log (this would only be 
possible by using a separate connection with another protocol (i.e. by using 
Samba, FTP, HTTP ... to make that file available)).
