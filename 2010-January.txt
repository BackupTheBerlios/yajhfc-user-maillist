Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Experimental Debian and Ubuntu packages for YajHFC
Message-ID: <201001031152.49625.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

In the last few days, new .deb packages for YajHFC have been created. 
They have been tested with Debian 5.0 ("Lenny") and Ubuntu 9.1 and probably 
should work with other versions of Debian or Ubuntu, too.

These packages support an easy installation of YajHFC and an automatic 
installation of a "fax printer" in CUPS (just like the Windows setup does for 
Windows).

The packages include a beta version of YajHFC 0.4.3 (and not 0.4.2a), because 
I had to make some extensions to YajHFC in order to support a reliable, 
automatic fax printer creation with CUPS.

While working on the fax printer package, I created a short guide how to 
manually install a fax printer in YajHFC (e.g. if you use a rpm based 
distribution or the packages do not work for you for some other reason).

You can access this guide at:
http://yajhfc.berlios.de/doc/cupsfaxprinter.shtml

A JAR file of the YajHFC 0.4.3beta can be downloaded here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0_4_3beta1.jar


If you use Debian or Ubuntu and want to try out the packages, the recommended 
way is to add the YajHFC apt repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list. To do 
so, please add the following line to that file (or use some graphical utility 
to edit your package sources...) and do an "apt-get update".

deb ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt stable/

The packages found there should work for both Debian and Ubuntu, so you can 
use the same apt line for both distributuions.

Usually you will receive a warning that my packages are not authenticated 
(since I am not a Debian or Ubuntu maintainer). 
You can either ignore this warning or import my public key and do another 
apt-get update, so that apt knows that I am "trustworthy".
To import the public key, execute the following command in a terminal:

wget -q http://yajhfc.berlios.de/JonasWolz.pub -O - | sudo apt-key add -

After successfully adding the repository, you will have two additional 
packages available:
yajhfc            -- Installs the jar file, a launcher and adds a menu
                     shortcut
yajhfc-faxprinter -- Installs a fax printer in CUPS

You can now install the packages just like any other package for your 
distribution (e.g. by issuing "apt-get install yajhfc-faxprinter").


If you do not want to add my apt repository, you can also manually download 
and install the debs from here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt/stable/yajhfc_0.4.3~beta1-1_all.deb
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt/stable/yajhfc-faxprinter_0.4.3~beta1-1_all.deb


I hope that the packages will work for you (since this is the first time I 
created and published Debian packages...).
If you have any problems or feedback, please write me a mail or to the 
yajhfc-user mailing list.


Have fun and a Happy New Year,
Jonas Wolz

Message-ID: <201001051502.11501.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

In addition to the Debian/Ubuntu packages, now there are also some RPM 
packages available.
The RPMs were created and tested on openSUSE 11.2.
They probably will also work with older SUSE versions and other RPM based 
distributions, but as I have not tested this, I cannot promise anything (so 
use them at your own risk... ;-) ).

You can download the two packages from:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0.4.2.99beta1-1.noarch.rpm
and
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-faxprinter-0.4.2.99beta1-1.noarch.rpm

Message-ID: <20100126201300.GJ5955@syscon4.inet>

YajHFC is reading faxes on my local network just fine.
But I'm puzzle why isn't retrieving fax list from another local Hylafax-server.

Here is the scenario:
IP 10.0.0.109 is running Hylafax-server - YajHFC works OK

local sub-network: 192.168.1.2 is running Hylafax-server - YajHFC works OK

I can read fax-list with YajHFC in box 192.168.1.2 from server: 10.0.0.109
but I can not read faxes from  10.0.0.109 that have been stored on 192.168.1.2

server: 192.168.1.2 has firewall OFF and port forwarding from 4559 to 4559 on 192.168.1.2 is enabled.

let me get this straight: you have a client in the 192.168.1.0/24 
network. this client can access a server at 192.168.1.2 but not a server 
at 10.0.0.109, right? sounds like a basic routing problem to me

Yes, it would seem so but I can not figure it out.
Gateway 10.0.0.1
Hylafax server 1) - 10.0.0.109

a) subnetwork 2) eth0 IP - 10.0.0.151
                  eth1 IP (lan) - 192.168.1.1
In internal subnet 2 router I'm forwarding 4559 from 10.0.0.151 to 4559 192.168.1.2
(192.168.1.2) another hylafax server.

Firewall between internal network is disabled, nmap is showing open port 4559 on  10.0.0.151
In YajHFC --> server (tab) I entered IP:  10.0.0.151 but it can not connect.

ssh, VPN between these two networks work OK except hylafax.  As I've mentioned I can access Hylafax 10.0.0.109 from 192.168.1.2 but not other way around.
So I'm puzzled.

If you have (need) port forwarding then you need to deal with hylafax protocol
as with ftp. For example, if you use Linux, you should load nf_conntrack_ftp module
with parameter ports=21,4559.

Is it a kernel module ?
Where do I enter/enable:  ports=21,4559

Yes, if you use iptables firewall, you have this module loaded probably.

> Where do I enter/enable:  ports=21,4559

As I use shorewall, I modify /etc/shorewall/modules like this:
-loadmodule nf_conntrack_ftp
+loadmodule nf_conntrack_ftp ports=21,4559

Or you can most probably use modprobe nf_conntrack_ftp ports=21,4559
(I didn't check it).
IIRC nf_conntrack_ftp was called ip_conntrack_ftp in earlier kernels.

I think I would need:
a) run "nf_conntrack_ftp" as module on the server I'm connecting to
  at the moment "nf_conntrack_ftp" is compiled IN the kernel

b) modify grub.conf to load ports=21,4559 (making sure I can still boot it :-/)

c) my solution was to connect over VPN - no need to modify anything, it just works.

Dear Jonas,

can you publish the spec files from your rpms or the whole *.src.rpms?
I ask because i use CentOS 5 and isn't possible to install your rpms.
You or openSUSE 11.x use a new rpmlib (4) and CentOS an older one (3).

YajHFC uses the tray icon support of Java 6 to implement its tray icon. Most 
likely on one computer a Java version without tray icon support is used (e.g. 
Java 5).

So, are the Java versions on both computers identical?
(You can enter "java -version" in a terminal to check that.)


Hope that helps
Jonas

Thanks for the hint.
I just check:

On Machine 1) "Minimize to Tray" works
installed: 
dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17
virtual/jdk-1.6.0

java -V 
Could not create the Java virtual machine.

-----
On Machine 2) "Minimize to Tray" DOES NOT works
it only had installed: "virtual/jdk-1.6.0"
and the output of:
java -V
java ver. 1.6.0.0

so I installed in same as what Machine 1) has: dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17
so now they both have the same applications:
dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17
virtual/jdk-1.6.0

but "Minimize to Tray" still does not work.
and not the output of:
java -V 
Could not create the Java virtual machine.

What else should I check.

Message-ID: <201001301034.12096.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

Because of some user requests, I made the source packages for the YajHFC linux 
packages available.

Deb packages
=============

For the deb packages you can get them by adding the following apt line:
deb-src ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt stable/

Or by directly downloading the following files:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt/stable/sources/yajhfc_0.4.3~beta1-2.dsc
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt/stable/sources/yajhfc_0.4.3~beta1-2.tar.gz


Rpm packages
=============

You can download the source rpms from:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0.4.2.99beta1-1.src.rpm
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-faxprinter-0.4.2.99beta1-1.src.rpm


If you have any problems and/or feedback, please write me a mail or to the 
yajhfc-user mailing list.

Have fun
Jonas Wolz

Actually you will have to enter "java -version", "java -V" does not work with 
the Sun JVM.

Before checking other things, I would like to be absolutely sure that it is 
not a java version issue (if you have multiple java versions installed on one 
computer, it is still possible that YajHFC uses different versions on both 
computers...)

To check that, please start YajHFC on both computers, go to Help->About, 
select the tab "system properties" and check that the properties beginning 
with "java.runtime", "java.version" and "java.vm" are the same.

If these are the same, I would like to know the values of these properties and 
the version of XFCE on the computer where it does not work.

Thanks,
Jonas

Thank you for your help again, indeed on my second machine the active java was a 'icedtea6-bin'
I check Gentoo doc: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/java.xml
so checking my setting revealed:

java-config --list-available-vms
The following VMs are available for generation-2:
*1)	IcedTea6-bin 1.6.2 [icedtea6-bin]
  2)	Sun JDK 1.6.0.17 [sun-jdk-1.6]

setting it to sun-jdk solved the problem.
