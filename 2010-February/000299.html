Thank you very much for your work! 
I will try to make an updated developer version of YajHFC and a &quot;compiled&quot; 
version of the FAQ available tomorrow.

(You are right that there is no way to update the messages just by adding 
a .mo file since I use gettext's feature to directly compile .po files into 
Java classes (so I do not need to include extra gettext libs)).

&gt;<i> 1) I intentionally changed all the direct forms like &quot;please, do this&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;you can ...&quot; (program speaking to you directly) into &quot;it's necessary to do
</I>&gt;<i> this&quot; &quot;It's possible...&quot; (impersonal), because this is how usually programs
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;talk&quot; to the user in Italian.
</I>&gt;<i> I left the &quot;direct&quot; form in the faq, since the faq is usually informal.
</I>
OK, since I do not speak Italian I cannot judge which version is better.

&gt;<i> 2) I intentionally used more &quot;relaxed&quot; translations for all the JobFmt,
</I>&gt;<i> RcvFmt... parameters. I see in the English translation they are taken as is
</I>&gt;<i> from the faxstat man page, the problem is the faxstat man page is very
</I>&gt;<i> terse and often confusing, a direct translation into Italian would be even
</I>&gt;<i> more so.
</I>&gt;<i> I also restructured all these items to use the main word at the beginning,
</I>&gt;<i> when possible, so that they get display together in the option dialog, ie:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;consecutive failed dials
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;total dials
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;dials failed consecutively
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;dials total &#160; &#160;(the Italian equivalent sounds more OK...)
</I>
This probably should also have been done in the English translation (which 
will not be changed in the near future, however). So your translation is most 
likely better than the &quot;original&quot; here...


&gt;<i> 3) &quot;fax&quot; and &quot;fax job&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In the English translation sometimes &quot;fax&quot; is used, sometimes &quot;fax job&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> It seems &quot;fax job&quot; is used for queued (not completed) faxes, and &quot;fax&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> completed ones, but not always.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, since HylaFAX supports &quot;page&quot;, it could be said that &quot;fax job&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> used to distinguish the various kind of jobs HylaFAX supports.
</I>&gt;<i> However, HylaFAX is used 99,99% of the times to send fax, and in Italian
</I>&gt;<i> the word &quot;job&quot; cannot be translated in a meaningful and natural way in this
</I>&gt;<i> context; so I translated both &quot;fax&quot; and &quot;fax job&quot; with &quot;fax&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> When &quot;job&quot; is used like &quot;blah blah fax: job 123&quot; I used &quot;blah blah fax: ID
</I>&gt;<i> 123&quot;.
</I>
Well, most likely &quot;fax&quot; and &quot;fax job&quot; are simply used inconsistencely 
throughout the program (since it grew over several years and I did not really 
have a formal distinction between &quot;fax&quot; and &quot;fax job&quot; in mind while writing 
it...).

&gt;<i> 4) I really don't know how to correctly translate &quot;descriptor&quot; in the phone
</I>&gt;<i> book windows. I understand what it means, but I don't know if there is a
</I>&gt;<i> conventional/common use Italian expression to indicate that thing.
</I>
Probably &quot;descriptor&quot; is not the most user friendly English term for it 
either... (in the German translation I also kept it virtually untranslated 
(&quot;Deskriptor&quot;)).


Thanks again for your efforts
Jonas
