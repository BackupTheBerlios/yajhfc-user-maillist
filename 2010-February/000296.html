<PRE>I'm attaching a zip file containing:

new files:
	README_it.txt
	faq_it.tex

updated files:
	CommandLineOpts_it.po
	messages_it.po

All files are utf-8 w/o BOM.

I tried to keep them in sync, meaning using the exact same translation in
all of them.

I didn't find a way to update the docs just by adding a .mo file, so if you
speak Italian, please test the translation by downloading the UNOFFICIAL jar
file of 0.4.2a recompiled with the updated Italian stuff:
<A HREF="http://rapidshare.de/files/49125607/yajhfc.jar.html">http://rapidshare.de/files/49125607/yajhfc.jar.html</A>
(look into &quot;aiuto -&gt; documentazione&quot; too).
 

Note about updates to existing .po files:

1) I intentionally changed all the direct forms like &quot;please, do this&quot;, &quot;you
can ...&quot; (program speaking to you directly) into &quot;it's necessary to do this&quot;
&quot;It's possible...&quot; (impersonal), because this is how usually programs &quot;talk&quot;
to the user in Italian.
I left the &quot;direct&quot; form in the faq, since the faq is usually informal.

2) I intentionally used more &quot;relaxed&quot; translations for all the JobFmt,
RcvFmt... parameters. I see in the English translation they are taken as is
from the faxstat man page, the problem is the faxstat man page is very terse
and often confusing, a direct translation into Italian would be even more
so.
I also restructured all these items to use the main word at the beginning,
when possible, so that they get display together in the option dialog, ie:
	consecutive failed dials
	total dials
into
	dials failed consecutively
	dials total    (the Italian equivalent sounds more OK...)

3) &quot;fax&quot; and &quot;fax job&quot; 
In the English translation sometimes &quot;fax&quot; is used, sometimes &quot;fax job&quot;.
It seems &quot;fax job&quot; is used for queued (not completed) faxes, and &quot;fax&quot; for
completed ones, but not always.
Also, since HylaFAX supports &quot;page&quot;, it could be said that &quot;fax job&quot; is used
to distinguish the various kind of jobs HylaFAX supports.
However, HylaFAX is used 99,99% of the times to send fax, and in Italian the
word &quot;job&quot; cannot be translated in a meaningful and natural way in this
context; so I translated both &quot;fax&quot; and &quot;fax job&quot; with &quot;fax&quot;.
When &quot;job&quot; is used like &quot;blah blah fax: job 123&quot; I used &quot;blah blah fax: ID
123&quot;.

4) I really don't know how to correctly translate &quot;descriptor&quot; in the phone
book windows. I understand what it means, but I don't know if there is a
conventional/common use Italian expression to indicate that thing.
