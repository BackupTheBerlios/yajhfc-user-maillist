<PRE>Windows XP SP3, Java 6 upd18, YajHFC 0.4.2a

Right now you get the following info in the Windows notification area about
received faxes:
1) When a fax is received a message pops-up saying you received a fax, it
stays there for a few seconds (it seems the timer starts after you move
either the mouse or the keyboard, so that if you are away you still get to
see it)
2) When you hover the mouse over the icon in the notification area you get
&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/yajhfc-user">user at host</A> - XX unread faxes&quot;.
 
This behavior is optimal if you are the only user, or if there are a few
users.

However, in a situation like in a small company, where there are 10/20
users, it may happen that just one of them performs the task of &quot;received
fax monitor&quot;: ie, he/she will check for received faxes, see which person a
fax should be forwarded to, forward it (by mail or other means) so that that
user is from now on responsible for that fax, etc.
In this case, it would be ideal that just that user (the &quot;fax monitor&quot;) gets
the notifications, because for the others these can be distracting.

So there could be a new setting in Options-&gt;General
	&quot;Get info in the notification area about received faxes&quot;
	default: checked. (current behavior)
If unchecked it would disable the the notification #1, and the &quot;XX unread
faxes&quot; part of #2.

Or maybe handle these 2 events like the &quot;flash icon&quot;, so that &quot;flash icon&quot;
becomes &quot;give info in the notification area&quot; and if checked we'd get
flash+notification_area_message+hover_message. But this would be a change in
behavior.

Thanks
