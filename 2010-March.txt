What to specify in "server" setting to log-in with admin - mode and be able to delete faxes.

Message-ID: <4B9021C9.7010102@free.fr>

hi,

I installed 'YajHFC' on my ubuntu 9.04.

I tested with the interface in French to send a fax.
I select a file to fax, I put a fax number and send.
It's good.

I tested with openoffice and YajFHC vitual fax printer.
It's good.

But with a cover page, I get an error :

It looks like the PostScript produced for the cover page is not correct. To 
find out why I would like to have some more information:

Do you use the default cover page of YajHFC or do you use a custom one?

Which version of Java do you use? 
To find that out, please open YajHFC, go to "Help"->"About"->"System 
properties" and look at the entry "java.runtime.version" and the entries 
beginning with "java.vm".

Thanks,
Jonas

The HylaFAX admin password is not any system user's password; HylaFAX uses its 
own authentication system here (i.e. you have to create your own HylaFAX 
users and set passwords for them).

To use admin mode, you will have to use the faxadduser command (or edit the 
file hosts.hfaxd) to add an user with an admin password and then log in to 
HylaFAX as that user.

(For an example on editing hosts.hfaxd please see 
http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yajhfc-user/2008-December/000148.html ).


Hope that helps
Jonas

My server is smeserver 7.4, based on centos 4.
My computer is with ubuntu 9.04

I removed ghostscript-8.15.1 on my server
I installed ghostscript-7.07-33.11.el4 on my server

Now, it's good
no error with coverpage

Now I must look at the problem of archives
But I do not know java  :(

If you use PAM for authentication, just create a unix group with all
admin users and add the group name /var/spool/hylafax/etc/config file:
AdminGroup: groupname

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Poor quality sending of header & footer
Message-ID: <4B96996D.10008@southam.clara.co.uk>

hi,

I'm currently using hylapex but have been testing the yajhfc client 
which seems a whole lot better but when using it to send some types of 
faxes, the header and footer come out very poor. Hylapex does not have a 
problem.

If I preview in pdf, it looks fine yet when faxed comes out poor, when 
viewing in tiff it looks how it comes out (poor).

An example:

http://95.154.244.9/view1130382020861488215.png

There is content in the in middle which I've had to remove which uses a 
different font, the top part is text with the logo on the right. This is 
a report generated by Visual Foxpro.

Coverpage is in HTML and comes out fine.

I'm a bit lost atm!!

Richard

What YajHFC does is passing the PostScript/PDF generated from the document to 
send to HylaFAX which then uses GhostScript to convert it to black&white TIFF 
(which I considered the correct way of operation so far...).
When the document contains gray or colored parts, GhostScript by default 
dithers these parts which leads to the effect you encountered.
So far, I have found no way to stop GhostScript from doing that.

Hylapex obviously does something different here, which seems to result in a 
better quality. 
I will try to look at Hylapex in the next days/weeks to find out what it is...

I believe Hylapex does not provide PDF or PostScript to hylafax. It
should probably provide TIFF files already dithered using a good
algorithm.

An option you have, is to use gs stochastic dithering option. A detail
about this is available as ghostscript bug report:
http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=689633
On the same bug report, you'll see how to dither the an image using
libtiff tools.

Hi,
I scanned 2 documents and the scanner sent them to me as PDF.
I tried faxing them via YajHFC (0.4.0) so I printed from one of them and then in the multiple files section I try to add the second file but when I press on the add button the whole fax client freezes.
I tried the same thing with different pdf files and all is working fine.
Did you encounter this? Any idea why it happens?

Thanks and Regadrs

I did not encounter this so far. Does this happen only with one file from your 
scanner or with all of them?

If it happens only with one: How large is the file?
If it happens with all/more than one PDF from your scanner: Could you send me 
(to jonas.wolz at freenet.de) an example file where this happens?

Thanks!

Thanks you.

I've tried adding to /var/spool/fax/etc/config:
AdminGroup: uucp

since this is the group hylafax runs under but it doesn't work.

I've added user fax with password, using command:
faxadduser -a my_password fax

the user fax was added to: hosts.hfaxd
^fax@:::CL62lePLuiJNI

but when I try to login as "admin" it keeps telling me password incorrect:

An error occured in response to the password:
530 Password incorrect.

530 Password incorrect.

are you using PAM autentication? As already written, this only works
when hylafax use PAM.
Moreover, what happens when you try to access in admin mode? Do you have
a log to show us?

Bye,
Giuseppe

SOLVED

Creating admin user works: faxadduser -a password username
eg.
faxadduser -a 123 fax

the information is stored in:  hosts.hfaxd
^fax@:::CLAE8FA9374

However, this line is appended to the end of file: hosts.hfaxd
but it must be as a first line, and nobody mentioned this important information.

The first match that is found it will be process, so if one has in hosts.hfaxd
localhost
127.0.0.1
^fax@:::CLAE8FA9374

and you will try to access it from local server it will not work as "fax" user matches "localhost" as well, so it processed first, it never gets to the 
third line.

Hi all,
it seems to me that job send date is always left empty (it is the last
column on the sent table).
Is it a known problem or am I missing something?

Thanks,
Giuseppe
