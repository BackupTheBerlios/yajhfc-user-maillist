</I>
In 0.3.4 the initial display is now also done in the refresh thread. I don't 
know if this how much that helps, however, as the login is still done in the 
UI thread.

Related to that I set up a test server with 2000 faxes in the receive and done 
queue and made some measurements why the initial display takes a while:
On my test box here (AMD Athlon 850MHz/512 MB RAM with the test server running 
in a VMWare instance) it took about 2 seconds to retrieve a queue's job list 
from the server and below 0.2 seconds to process the retrieved data in 
YajHFC.
As the HylaFAX protocol seemingly doesn't support limiting the retrieved list 
in a reasonable way this means that there is probably not much potential to 
optimize...

However:
If anybody reading this knows a (preferably Open Source) client that refreshes 
noticeably faster than YajHFC, it would be nice if he or she could tell me 
its name. Then I could take a look at it trying to find out how the faster 
refresh is achieved.

Greetings,
Jonas
