<PRE>I did a little more searching on this and you are correct.  This is a
Hylafax warning and not related to Java.  However, it appeared that only
the Java clients I had tried were having an issue with it, thus I
thought this was a java thing.

I found a thread where someone had posted a patch for hylafax that
syslog'd the 'warning' rather than replying to the client.  I patched my
version of hylafax and recompiled and I'm working fine now.

However, what probably needs to happen is the Client handle this
response as the warning that it is and not a fatal error.  I think many
in the situation that I am in  (on a cable modem or DSL connection where
the ISP isn't properly setting up their DNS) are going to have this
problem.  It would be useful to warn the user but continue operation
anyway (it's not a fatal error ... and possibly a check box to 'not show
this error' again, when the user has no way of fixing the issue).

Hello,

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/yajhfc-user">MWilson at acesappraisal.com</A> schrieb:
&gt;<i> However, when I try to connect to it via Yajhfc (and all other Java 
</I>&gt;<i> clients I have tried ... so this is a Java problem, not a Yajhfc 
</I>&gt;<i> problem).  I get this error:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 130 Warning, no inverse address mapping for client host name 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;75-144-35-141-Chesterfield.hfc.comcastbusiness.net&quot;.
</I>
Actually that is a warning message from the HylaFAX server and not from 
Java.
It seems that the gnu.hylafax library (that YajHFC and probably most 
other Java clients use) interprets this as an error and not as a 
warning. So this is most probably a bug in that library.

Nevertheless I must do a more thorough analysis (i.e. reproduce that 
error) before I can be really sure about that.

&gt;<i> Is there any way to work around this?
</I>
Configure the HylaFAX server in a way so that it doesn't issue that 
warning. ;-)
Seriously: I currently don't know a &quot;real&quot; work around for that problem.

In the next days I will also check if this bug is still present in the 
latest version of the gnu.hylafax library and report it to the 
developers if it is (for &quot;historical reasons&quot; YajHFC currently uses a 
own fork of that library, but it also builds against the &quot;stock&quot; version

and I'm planning to stop using the fork in one of the next YajHFC
versions).

If a quick fix is possible, I'll probably publish a YajHFC jar with the 
fix included.

Regards,
Jonas
