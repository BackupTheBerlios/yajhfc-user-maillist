Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Error when using cable modem service and connecting
	to server over internet.
Message-ID: <B55301ABE760AA49BE5ADB32BF27A336066235@claims-new>

Hi,
 
I've been using Yajhfc to connect to my internal hylafax server with
great sucess.  However, I need to migrate that server to a Virtual
Private Server to take the bandwidth load off of my home/office
connection.
 
I have successfully setup my new Hylafax server and can access it via
Webmin, and send/receive faxes from the server.
 
However, when I try to connect to it via Yajhfc (and all other Java
clients I have tried ... so this is a Java problem, not a Yajhfc
problem).  I get this error:
 
130 Warning, no inverse address mapping for client host name
"75-144-35-141-Chesterfield.hfc.comcastbusiness.net".

I know that this has something to do with my cable provider not mapping
that Domain back to an IP.  This is a static IP, and I do have it mapped
to a DynDNS name, and I've even put a static entry in my hosts file to
map it.  However,  JAVA appears unable to see this.
 
Is there any way to work around this?

Actually that is a warning message from the HylaFAX server and not from 
Java.
It seems that the gnu.hylafax library (that YajHFC and probably most 
other Java clients use) interprets this as an error and not as a 
warning. So this is most probably a bug in that library.

Nevertheless I must do a more thorough analysis (i.e. reproduce that 
error) before I can be really sure about that.

> Is there any way to work around this?

Configure the HylaFAX server in a way so that it doesn't issue that 
warning. ;-)
Seriously: I currently don't know a "real" work around for that problem.

In the next days I will also check if this bug is still present in the 
latest version of the gnu.hylafax library and report it to the 
developers if it is (for "historical reasons" YajHFC currently uses a 
own fork of that library, but it also builds against the "stock" version 
and I'm planning to stop using the fork in one of the next YajHFC versions).

If a quick fix is possible, I'll probably publish a YajHFC jar with the 
fix included.

Jonas

I did a little more searching on this and you are correct.  This is a
Hylafax warning and not related to Java.  However, it appeared that only
the Java clients I had tried were having an issue with it, thus I
thought this was a java thing.

I found a thread where someone had posted a patch for hylafax that
syslog'd the 'warning' rather than replying to the client.  I patched my
version of hylafax and recompiled and I'm working fine now.

However, what probably needs to happen is the Client handle this
response as the warning that it is and not a fatal error.  I think many
in the situation that I am in  (on a cable modem or DSL connection where
the ISP isn't properly setting up their DNS) are going to have this
problem.  It would be useful to warn the user but continue operation
anyway (it's not a fatal error ... and possibly a check box to 'not show
this error' again, when the user has no way of fixing the issue).

This has been fixed in the gnu.hylafax library, so the next YajHFC 
release (0.3.4, will probably get done in early August/late July) will 
include the bug fix, too.
If somebody else encounters this bug before 0.3.4 is released, please 
contact me (in that case I can send you a "pre-release" jar file with 
the bugfix included).

Jonas

Hi again!

I would like to make two non-urgent feature requests
for future yajhfc releases.

1) automatic row count or labelling, especially useful
on the sent table which can be very long even when
filters are applied. I can select all and copy/paste
to Excel/OO and get row numbers but it would be
quicker to have it on yajhfc.

2) in user options, "kill time" should be customizable
(either as a general option or as a per-job option or
both).

Anyway, these are just suggestions. ;-)

0.3.3 has been very stable until now (1911 faxes
sent).

Should be easy to add (although this feature certainly won't be in the 
next release which probably will be done next weekend ;-) ).

"Cancel job after (minutes)" in the send dialog should probably do what 
you want (or do you mean something different?).

Good to hear :-)

Hi Jonas,

could a "default killtime" be specified in the
"settings" config file (just like max tries)?

Also, I noticed that when a user has a lot of jobs in
the "sent" table and is about to send another fax via
printing redirection, there is a significant delay
before the send dialog actually appears. It's probably
because it has to wait for the hylafax server to
transfer the whole job list so that yajhfc can display
it in its grid and THEN the "send" dialog box appears.
Can we find a way to reduce or elinminate this delay?
If threading is not doable, can the sent and received
tables be "invisible" (thus no hylafax job list
transfer necessary) until a user specifically
activates the table views?
Basically, yajhfc doesn't need to "load" the job list
from hylafax if it's a printing redirection and if
yajhfc is configured to automatically close itself
once the job has been submitted.

Just a thought...

Vieri

Still another request would be to review the way
yajhfc saves the redirected printer port data to a
temp file for sending.
In Windows XP it seems that yajhfc needs to write to
C:\WINDOWS\TEMP but this dir is usually not writable
to standard domain users. 
What I did was make it writable but it would be better
if yajhfc could use the user profile's temp dir.
In VBS you can retrieve it like so:
Set oEnv = WshShell.Environment("Process")
TMP = oEnv.item("TEMP")

I don't know how you can do that in Java and if it's
"portable".

No problem, will be in 0.3.4 (actually I thought it would already save 
this...).

I see the problem you mean.
Actually the table refresh is already multi-threaded, but for the first 
time after connecting it is currently still done in the UI thread. 
Before changing that I have to look if there is (still) a reason for 
that or if it can be safely removed.
Anyway, I will try to find some solution for that.

Jonas

Reading environment variables is no problem in Java, but I doubt it 
would help as the environment is often "broken" during printing 
redirection (i.e. probably the TEMP environment variable points to 
C:\WINDOWS\TEMP there).
So, this probably needs to be fixed in the launcher script (by including 
-Djava.io.tmpdir=... on the java command line).

I will try to analyse this problem when I have some time in the next 
days/weeks. After I have found a solution I will write another mail to 
this list.

Jonas

As suspected above the problem was that the TEMP and TMP variables pointed to

I added some code to the launcher script to correct this (the updated version 
can be downloaded from the homepage and is included in the 0.3.4 setup.exe, 
too).

In 0.3.4 the initial display is now also done in the refresh thread. I don't 
know if this how much that helps, however, as the login is still done in the 
UI thread.

Related to that I set up a test server with 2000 faxes in the receive and done 
queue and made some measurements why the initial display takes a while:
On my test box here (AMD Athlon 850MHz/512 MB RAM with the test server running 
in a VMWare instance) it took about 2 seconds to retrieve a queue's job list 
from the server and below 0.2 seconds to process the retrieved data in 
YajHFC.
As the HylaFAX protocol seemingly doesn't support limiting the retrieved list 
in a reasonable way this means that there is probably not much potential to 
optimize...

However:
If anybody reading this knows a (preferably Open Source) client that refreshes 
noticeably faster than YajHFC, it would be nice if he or she could tell me 
its name. Then I could take a look at it trying to find out how the faster 
refresh is achieved.

Thank you Jonas for all your work.
I will start testing 0.3.4 on Monday.
As far as the above issue is concerned, *maybe* the
initial 2-second delay can be eliminated by avoiding
the job list retrieval. I'm saying this because most
of the time users just "print to a fax virtual
printer", enter the dest fax number, press send and
that's it. Besides, we have it configured so that
yajhfc terminates after the user presses "send" on the
dialog box.

So maybe just the dialog box could show up when
configured this way (thus no need to display and fill
the job grid data)
-OR-
if it's programmatically simpler, let the main
application appear behind the dialog box *but* disable
job list retrieval internally, as it won't be used by
the user anyway.
The only thing that yajhfc would need to do before
actually sending the new fax is grab the user's login
credentials.

Anyway, I'll check 0.3.4 out as you say that it's now
in a different thread.

By the way, your 2-second delay is a tad more for me
because my HylaFAX service is on a robust but weaker
server (pentium 2, etc.). :-(

Have a nice weekend.

Am I the only one having trouble accessing BerliOS?
The system has been down for a while now and I can't
download yajhfc.
Actually, this email will probably not reach any ML
subscriber until the system is back up... :-(

All of a sudden my Redmon/Yajhfc clients have stopped working.  I have
done some googling on the Java error indicated but nothing on how to
fix.
Here is the output from Redmon Log:  Anyone have any ideas?  I can still
connect to my server and see the faxes ... I can send from the send fax
dialog from within the client (if sending a file) - but can't use

Currently the berlios HTTP server seems to be up again.

Nevertheless, what I noticed when BerliOS had really severe availability 
problems in early January (due to a dDOS attack) was that the HTTPS service 
often was still up while HTTP was down, i.e. https://yajhfc.berlios.de/ 
worked while http://yajhfc.berlios.de/ was down.
Maybe that helps in the future...

I only found the following bug database entry, too:
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6544857

According to it the bug only occurs with Java 6 update 2, so the obvious 
workaround would be to simply install another Java version.

As it seems to work from your user account you might also try to use the 
wrapper script at 
http://yajhfc.berlios.de/doc/yajhfc-launcher.shtml
to launch YajHFC from Redmon (that script sets the correct values for some 
environment variables which are still set to values for the user LocalService 
when a program is started by Redmon).
I don't know if the latter will be of any help, however.

Hope that helps,
Jonas
