No, it also makes sense when you are not root, as HylaFAX implements its own 
user authentication system.
For example, adding the following line to hosts.hfaxd will &quot;create&quot; a 
user &quot;fax&quot; with both password and admin password &quot;fax&quot;:
^<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/yajhfc-user">fax at .</A>*$::jk7fbGIw26tYs:jk7fbGIw26tYs

When this user logs in as admin, he can view and delete any fax (technically 
he has the same rights as the user &quot;hfaxd&quot; runs under (&quot;uucp&quot; on Debian) -- 
this user also owns /var/spool/fax and all sub directories).

&gt;<i> Second, this is such a great tool! Why don't you ask the different Linux
</I>&gt;<i> distributions in order to include it?
</I>
Well, to be honest, because I did not take the time so far to find out where I 
can suggest new packages for the different distributions.
Of course, I would not object if someone else wants to do that instead... ;-)

If such a suggestion results in the creation of a new package (or if someone 
wants to do that independently from a distribution), it is also no problem to 
offer some assistance for that (e.g. to find out the correct dependencies). 
I currently do not have the time to create such a package myself, however 
(because I would first need to become acquainted with the packaging system 
and policy of the distribution in question).


Regards,
Jonas
