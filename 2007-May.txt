Subject: [Yajhfc-user] destination fax from agenda
Message-ID: <522708.15734.qm@web32613.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi again Jonas et al.!

Is it possible to include not just the destination fax
number in the hylafax report but also the destination
name/company name?

As far as YAJHFC is concerned, it seems that each time
it sends a fax it only grabs the faxnumber field from
the agenda (we use the JDBC MySQL agenda). Could it be
configured so that it sends ''Company name at faxnumber''
(by automatically combining database fields)?

Hi,

I'd like to make another request ;-).

Could it be possible to limit the number of rows
displayed in each table (mostly doneq). For instance,
"display the most recent 50 rows".

We currently have 1060 lines in our "doneq" table and
it's starting to be heavy on the refresh routine. I
don't know if the hylafax protocol has a way of doing
this (which would be best as to limit bandwidth
consumption as much as possible) but otherwise, yajhfc
can just filter out the rows itself (at least it saves
on graphic display and mem usage).

Thanks

Vieri

Would be possible, but I don't know if it would improve on your problem (see 
below).

How did you notice that?

The HylaFAX protocol is just an extended FTP protocol. 

The lists of faxes are retrieved by a "normal" LIST command. I don't know if 
there is a way to limit the number of retrieved rows (and then the sorting 
probably would be still undefined).

Graphic display shouldn't be the big problem because the table paints only  
the visible rows (if I understand the documentation correctly). If you have 
had a different experience please tell me.

So the only problem such a limit could improve on would be memory usage (but 
on the other hand every entry should use at most a few hundred bytes so I 
don't know if this is really relevant).

Nevertheless I am very interested in eliminating performance problems, so I 
would like to get more information about the symptoms you noticed.

Regards,
Jonas

I have no idea...

YajHFC should set the fax job's company, location, ... fields if a phone book 
entry is used (or if the user enters the information into the corresponding 
fields). 
If it does not, this is probably a bug.

Where should YajHFC send ''Company name at faxnumber'' in your opinion?
I doubt sending that as the phone number would work... (or probably I 
understood you wrong).

Jonas

It seems that there's a slightly longer delay before
displaying the initial screen (the done table). But
maybe it was just a temp network bottleneck (I didn't
thoroughly test this).

We are not experiencing significant performance
problems (yet). I just wanted to post this issue on
the list to see if someone had exprience with 1000+
faxes and thus prevent future issues.

I'll make more thorough tests during the next few
weeks and will try to record speed and mem usage.

Thanks

I used to use sendfax as a mail to fax gateway and
from its man page one can specify that format.
However , I now realize that even with the following
command:
 # /usr/bin/sendfax -n -R -o vieri -f vieri at domain.org
-d COMPANY at 971555555 faxtest.ps
hylafax's notify script does not include COMPANY but
just 971555555.

I'm sure yajhfc passes all the information via TCP/IP
so I just need to dig into Hylafax?s notify script.
ie. this is not a yajhfc issue, sorry.

Has someone tested YAJHFC with HYLAFAX+ (http://hylafax.sourceforge.net)?

I just checked the doneq jobs and the notify script
and it's clear enough that the $receiver variable
holds the data I need. I thought that variable held
the string ID of the remote fax machine because I got
confusing information from my users.
Anyway I seem to be getting a clearer picture of what
I need.

Definitely not a yajhfc issue.
Sorry.

I haven't tested it, but after taking a quick look at the homepage it seems 
that the protocol is the same (they also mention other popular HylaFAX 
clients in the HOWTO).

So YajHFC should probably work with it (although I'd also like to hear 
some "test result" if someone did actually test it with YajHFC).

Jonas
