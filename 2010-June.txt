Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAJEWdbNAv25Pnvwrik6JRw+COQIAEAAAAAFxMqcREd9Nhmg7Voo1U/sBAAAAAA==@gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I am testing this software to implement it to multiple users in several
departments and I have found some doubts:

- Can I block the client software to only see the faxes sent by a specific
user?. I have marked the "only own faxes" option in the View menu, but the
user can change it to the "All faxes" and view all faxes.

- There are any way to block the access to "options" in the Extra menu to
the users?

- When I delete the ".../.yajhfc/settings" file and run yajhfc again, it
creates the setting file again. Where is this information to delete it?


Best regards,

Ramses

Hi Ramses,

I think you can use settings.override to force "allowChangeFilter=false"

You can see also Documentation: How can I specify some default settings?

As Stefano Lusuaardi already has said: You can 
specify "allowChangeFilter=false" in the settings file (or better 
settings.override).

No. But you can use the settings.override file to override some settings. 
The user will be able to change them anyway, but they will be reset to the 
values specified there the next time YajHFC starts.

Currently this file is always created because YajHFC saves its settings there.
Why do you want to delete it? (Serious question, I am wondering what you are 
trying to do...)

I change this param and it works well. So I tried find information about
this parameter and other, but I am not found nothing. There are some
information about this?

I have also created the setting.override file and works fine. Thanks.

As I said, I am testing the yajhfc and once I deleted the setting file. So,
when I started the yajhfc client, I was surprised that it created the
setting file again.

Jonas, good morning,

Other question about to block "Options" to the user:

If I have the config in the settings.default file or settings.overrride
file, the user can't save the config but it can to change, by example, the
modem and send faxes with the new config, isn't it?

Yes, this is possible.
But if you are afraid of such behaviour, in my opinion, it is not a good idea 
to try to prevent this on the client anyway. The better approach is to 
configure the server to prevent that instead (else the user can use a 
different client to circumvent the restrictions, for example).

Sorry me by my ignorant, can you tell me how to config the server to do
that?

Another thing, if the user isn't administrator, he can't delete a FAX of
other user, but it can see it. This is a bug or I have a bad configuration?


Best regards and thaks by everything,

Ramses

Hello All,

is there a possibility to get the HylaFAX job ID for a document sent with
YajHFC?

Or can someone imagine/suggest another possibitlity how to identify a
document/fax sent with YajHFC uniquely for further processing?

(We have YajHFC 0.4.2a and Hylafax 4.4.4.)


Thanks in advance
