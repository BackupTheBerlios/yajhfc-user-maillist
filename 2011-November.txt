Subject: [Yajhfc-user] YajHFC 0.5.1 released
Message-ID: <201111011541.11635.jonas@yajhfc.de>

I am pleased to announce that version 0.5.1 of YajHFC has been released today.

The available files with download links can be found on the following page:
http://www.yajhfc.de/downloads/current-version

New features/changes:
- Added console only add on
- Changed URLs from yajhfc.berlios.de to www.yajhfc.de
- Some bugfixes and minor feature enhancements

This is actually a rather minor release (except for the console add-on). 
The focus is mainly to collect all the bug fixes and small enhancement from 
the last half year and of course to update all URLs to the new homepage.


If you have any questions and/or feedback about the new release, please write 
to the yajhfc-user at googlegroups.com mailing list or to support at yajhfc.de

For more information you may also take a look at the homepage at:

Have Fun,
Jonas Wolz
