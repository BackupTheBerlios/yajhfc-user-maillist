Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Feature request: send fax dialog: extended resolutions
Message-ID: <20100201084941.E34E9FACB@i3.golden.dom>

Windows XP SP3, Java 6 upd18, YajHFC 0.4.2a

Right now you can choose between:
	Low (98 lpi)
	High (196 lpi)
It would be useful to add a 3rd option:
	Normal (98 lpi)
	Fine (196 lpi)
	Hyperfine (392 lpi)
or, rounding and using a more common term:
	Normal (100 dpi)
	Fine (200 dpi)
	Hyperfine (400 dpi)

Selecting hyperfine would cause the client to set
	USEXVRES=yes ("sendfax -G")
asking HylaFAX to use the maximum available resolution.

This is useful when sending documents with small fonts.

Right now the only way to get this is to manually set USEXVRES in the "job
properties" dialog.

Thanks.

Windows XP SP3, Java 6 upd18, YajHFC 0.4.2a

I have
	Minimize to tray: checked
	Auto-size status bar:checked

I then edit the cmdline of link created by the setup program (in the start
menu) to be
	......execyajhfc.vbs --windowstate=I
Starting YajHFC will cause the expected behavior:
- fax icon displayed in the middle of the screen
- ghost of the main window on the screen
- window immediately minimized to notification area and fax icon disappears
from middle of the screen

I then edit the cmdline of link created by the setup program (in the start
menu) to be
	......execyajhfc.vbs --windowstate=T
Starting YajHFC will cause some unexpected behavior:
- fax icon displayed in the middle of the screen
- no window ghost
- notification area icon displayed
- unexpected n.1: fax icon remains displayed in the middle of the screen; it
will go away when you click on the notification area icon.
- unexpected n.2: when you click on the notification area icon, you discover
that the "Auto-size status bar" is now UNchecked, so that no status bar is
visible.

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Feature request: send fax dialog: "time to send"
Message-ID: <20100201084926.9272BFAC9@i3.golden.dom>

Windows XP SP3, Java 6 upd18, YajHFC 0.4.2a

If using "traditional" send-fax dialog you can set everything but for the
"time to send".
If using "simplified" you cannot set things like all of the faxcover
entries, but you can set the "time to send".

I think it's more likely an user would want to change "time to send"  than
say "Maximum tries".

So I think it would be useful to promote "time to send" to a more visible
status, meaning it should be both in the simplified and traditional layouts,
and in a more prominent position (always visible), placed even before
"notify when".

Thanks

Hi all,

can not see previous post on archive of list, thus sending question once
again. Please forgive eventually double-posting.


In the manual of "hylafax-server" in the subsection "JOB SCHEDULING"
following is mentioned:
"Outbound jobs are scheduled by a single process. Jobs have a ''scheduling
priority'' that is assigned at the time the job is submitted. This priority
can be changed at any time the job is not actively being processed using the
faxalter(1m) program. ..."

My question: Is it possible with YajHFC to set this 'scheduling priority'?
(Did not find anything)


Many thanks
A.

Hello,

I have installed YajHFC on various clients XP. It works great.
Many features, very good interface and integration wth mysql, my compliments.
But... The users would like to send multiple documents per fax also in  .doc 
and .docx. format and
the client, of course, shows this error: yajhfc.file.UnknownFormatException: 
Unsupported file format:...
Is there a possibility that .doc and .docx will be included in a next version 
of YajHFC?
Is there a java class to include in source code for that (sorry, i'm not a 
Java programmer)?
Thanks a lot for your good work, and sorry for my English..
Pasquale

It's a "manual" setting:
1) Options, delivery, job properties, key=SCHEDPRI value=(see sendfax
manpage for "-P")
or for every fax
2) Sendfax "simplified" send dialog, job properties, ....

Are you printing the docs through the YajHFC printer or adding them
manually in the send dialog? If the latter, then try the former.

Ok, didn't pay attention to "multiple".

As far as I know the send fax dialog will allow you to only use files that
can be handled by HylaFAX directly or by YajHFC via ghostscript.

If you want to use other file formats you have to go through the virtual
printer, because that way the originating applications + Windows will
convert the file for you.

So, I think the best option is to use pdfcreator which will allow you to add
to its virtual printer queue multiple documents in whatever format and
combine them to produce a single PDF file which you can feed to YajHFC
either through "send file" or printer.

So user would have to do:
- open doc n.1, print to pdfcreator, choose "wait - collect"
- open doc n.2, print to pdfcreator ...
- ....
- in pdfcreator select "combine all", "print"
- you get 1 PDF file which you send via fax.

Hi,

I have a small feature request. I use on our server a AVM C4 controller
with 4 ISDN-Lines. So we have 8 different modems to send and receive in
hylafax. Is it possible to set on the command line a specific modem to
send (--modem=faxCAPI11 or so)?
At this moment i must work with different config files and the
"defaultmodem" keyword.

OK, I can reproduce this here. This problem will be fixed in the next release.

"Auto-size status bar" is still checked, however. It might have to do with the 
problem above, however. 
So, once it is fixed in the developer version I would like to contact you 
again to test if this problem is fixed for you, too.


Thanks for the bug report,
Jonas

Well, actually you can set more things in the "simplified" one (since it is 
the newer dialog). The place is different, however (for example the faxcover 
entries are set in the table with the recipients).

I will think about this, but most probably I will not make it always visible 
(other users might almost never use the "time to send" setting...).

I see this is probably a good idea (until now I did not even realize that 
HylaFAX supports finer resolutions than 196 lpi).

Just one question: 
Does USEXVRES=yes really mean "392 lpi" or just "use whatever the maximum is"?
(The HylaFAX documentation is a bit unclear about that...)

This is correct. 
Direct support for .doc/.docx probably will never come since it is a 
proprietary, very complex format from Microsoft, which basically only Word 
itself (and partly OpenOffice) can read correctly.

This is one possible way to do it.

There is another, unfortunately undocumented way to do it, too:

Start the registry editor and change the value 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\YajHFC\printlaunchyajhfcparams 
from "--stdin --background" to "--stdin --background --no-wait".

After this change, the virtual print job will not wait for the send dialog to 
be closed before it is completed.
So you can print the first document, print the second one, ... and all of them 
will be "collected" in the send dialog that opens after the first one has 
been printed (as long as you keep the dialog open, of course).
If all documents to send have been printed, you can simply use the send dialog 
as normal and send a fax incorporating all of the documents.

Hope that helps
Jonas

Currently this is not possible, but I will consider to add this feature to one

This is using the best resolution that both sender and receiver can
handle. For example, an MT5656ZDX modemfax can handle these:

FaxGetty[2724]: MODEM Supports 3.85 line/mm
FaxGetty[2724]: MODEM Supports 7.7 line/mm
FaxGetty[2724]: MODEM Supports 15.4 line/mm
FaxGetty[2724]: MODEM Supports R16 x 15.4 line/mm
FaxGetty[2724]: MODEM Supports 200 x 100 dpi
FaxGetty[2724]: MODEM Supports 200 x 200 dpi
FaxGetty[2724]: MODEM Supports 200 x 400 dpi
FaxGetty[2724]: MODEM Supports 300 x 300 dpi

I don't use the phone book, just copy/paste the faxno, so I didn't notice
that I could input the cover data (name/last name/company) in that table, I
thought it was just used when getting data from the phone book

So my original request is moot and can be discarded.

It's like asking for 196 lpi, you tell HylaFAX to use up to X, if the remote
supports something less it will use less.

Hi All,

I have just installed YAJHFC 0.4.2a (RedmonEE) on 10 of out Windows 2003 Citrix servers. All works well...however when i try and link the address book to our Microsoft SQL Server, on 3 servers it works perfectly, however on the other 7 servers (which are identical) when you click OK after adding all the connection info, javaw.exe takes 60% of the CPU and just hangs for over 30mins....i killed it at this point. All JDBC drivers/Java versions etc are identical.

Has anybody else had this problem?

Thanks
Court

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Italian translations update
Message-ID: <20100209201659.554DEFAC9@i3.golden.dom>

I'm attaching a zip file containing:

new files:
	README_it.txt
	faq_it.tex

updated files:
	CommandLineOpts_it.po
	messages_it.po

All files are utf-8 w/o BOM.

I tried to keep them in sync, meaning using the exact same translation in
all of them.

I didn't find a way to update the docs just by adding a .mo file, so if you
speak Italian, please test the translation by downloading the UNOFFICIAL jar
file of 0.4.2a recompiled with the updated Italian stuff:
http://rapidshare.de/files/49125607/yajhfc.jar.html
(look into "aiuto -> documentazione" too).
 

Note about updates to existing .po files:

1) I intentionally changed all the direct forms like "please, do this", "you
can ..." (program speaking to you directly) into "it's necessary to do this"
"It's possible..." (impersonal), because this is how usually programs "talk"
to the user in Italian.
I left the "direct" form in the faq, since the faq is usually informal.

2) I intentionally used more "relaxed" translations for all the JobFmt,
RcvFmt... parameters. I see in the English translation they are taken as is
from the faxstat man page, the problem is the faxstat man page is very terse
and often confusing, a direct translation into Italian would be even more
so.
I also restructured all these items to use the main word at the beginning,
when possible, so that they get display together in the option dialog, ie:
	consecutive failed dials
	total dials
into
	dials failed consecutively
	dials total    (the Italian equivalent sounds more OK...)

3) "fax" and "fax job" 
In the English translation sometimes "fax" is used, sometimes "fax job".
It seems "fax job" is used for queued (not completed) faxes, and "fax" for
completed ones, but not always.
Also, since HylaFAX supports "page", it could be said that "fax job" is used
to distinguish the various kind of jobs HylaFAX supports.
However, HylaFAX is used 99,99% of the times to send fax, and in Italian the
word "job" cannot be translated in a meaningful and natural way in this
context; so I translated both "fax" and "fax job" with "fax".
When "job" is used like "blah blah fax: job 123" I used "blah blah fax: ID
123".

4) I really don't know how to correctly translate "descriptor" in the phone
book windows. I understand what it means, but I don't know if there is a
conventional/common use Italian expression to indicate that thing.

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Feature request: make info about received faxes
	optional
Message-ID: <20100212085823.AEB9CF990@i3.golden.dom>

Windows XP SP3, Java 6 upd18, YajHFC 0.4.2a

Right now you get the following info in the Windows notification area about
received faxes:
1) When a fax is received a message pops-up saying you received a fax, it
stays there for a few seconds (it seems the timer starts after you move
either the mouse or the keyboard, so that if you are away you still get to
see it)
2) When you hover the mouse over the icon in the notification area you get
"user at host - XX unread faxes".
 
This behavior is optimal if you are the only user, or if there are a few
users.

However, in a situation like in a small company, where there are 10/20
users, it may happen that just one of them performs the task of "received
fax monitor": ie, he/she will check for received faxes, see which person a
fax should be forwarded to, forward it (by mail or other means) so that that
user is from now on responsible for that fax, etc.
In this case, it would be ideal that just that user (the "fax monitor") gets
the notifications, because for the others these can be distracting.

So there could be a new setting in Options->General
	"Get info in the notification area about received faxes"
	default: checked. (current behavior)
If unchecked it would disable the the notification #1, and the "XX unread
faxes" part of #2.

Or maybe handle these 2 events like the "flash icon", so that "flash icon"
becomes "give info in the notification area" and if checked we'd get
flash+notification_area_message+hover_message. But this would be a change in
behavior.

Thanks

You could try one thing:
Use the ODBC<->JDBC bridge together with an ODBC driver for SQL server 
(generally, it is almost always preferable to use a native JDBC driver, 
though).

According to Sun's documentation the driver class is 
sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver.

Data base URLs look like this:
    jdbc:odbc:<data-source-name>[;<attribute-name>=<attribute-value>]*
For example:
    jdbc:odbc:sybase
    jdbc:odbc:mydb;UID=me;PWD=secret
    jdbc:odbc:ora123;Cachesize=300



For further debugging, you could also start YajHFC in debug mode and look at 
the last few lines in the log to see where it hangs (I do not want to exclude 
the possibility that the reason for the problem is a bug in my client 
triggered by some weird behaviour of the JDBC driver...).


Hope that helps
Jonas

Thank you very much for your work! 
I will try to make an updated developer version of YajHFC and a "compiled" 
version of the FAQ available tomorrow.

(You are right that there is no way to update the messages just by adding 
a .mo file since I use gettext's feature to directly compile .po files into 
Java classes (so I do not need to include extra gettext libs)).

OK, since I do not speak Italian I cannot judge which version is better.

This probably should also have been done in the English translation (which 
will not be changed in the near future, however). So your translation is most 
likely better than the "original" here...

Well, most likely "fax" and "fax job" are simply used inconsistencely 
throughout the program (since it grew over several years and I did not really 
have a formal distinction between "fax" and "fax job" in mind while writing 
it...).

Probably "descriptor" is not the most user friendly English term for it 
either... (in the German translation I also kept it virtually untranslated 
("Deskriptor")).


Thanks again for your efforts

I will put this feature request on the "wish list". Since it is probably not 
too hard implement, chances are good it will be available in one of the next 
releases.
