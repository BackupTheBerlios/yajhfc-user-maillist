Currently this is not possible directly. 
One reason for that is that I currently do not have a good idea on how to pass 
this information on to another program. 
If you have a good suggestion for that, any input is welcome...

Hello,
I'm doing this with the sendfax parameter "-i" in a script that does 
mail2fax and print to smb-printer. This parameter plus some others are 
then saved by FaxAccounting in a mysql table and it is used also in the 
confirmation email ("The fax with subject blah, ID blah-blah has been 
sent to recipient blah at 555-555-5555")

 From man sendfax:

*-i* /identifier/

    Use the /identifier/ string in any notification messages instead of
    the usual job identifier number. This option is useful for
    applications that cross reference notification messages against job
    submissions.

One possibility for example could be to write the Job Id to stdout, if
YajHFC is called from CLI.

Another could be for example to write/log the job Ids (with time and date)
to a separate file, governed by a flag like
"--job-id-file="filename-to-log-to""


What is your opinion?

Could you send me an example for that problem (original document and send 
report)?

Thanks

Both should be possible, although the secons method seems more appealing to 
me.
I will put this feature on the "wish list" for future releases.

Message-ID: <201007251326.04459.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

In the coming weeks YajHFC 0.4.4 will be released.

Because this release contains several changes (especially regarding the 
printing of the fax tables and phone books), a release candidate/beta version 
has been published to get some feedback/testing before the actual release.

You can download the jar file / Windows setup / Linux packages / MAC app 
(new!) from

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/0.4.4rc

You are encouraged to test this version and give feedback if you find any 
problems with it.

The translations (except German) are still incomplete, but they will be 
updated as soon as they are ready.

Changes in YajHFC 0.4.4:
- Improved MAC OS support (mostly cosmetic changes)
- Support to enter custom file converters
- Access to advanced settings over UI
- Support to print phone books
- Improved printing of faxes
- Support for @@CCNameAndFax@@ Tag in HTML cover pages
- Resend fax for multiple recipients
- Log console to view the log live
- Separation of view and send format for faxes
- User-editable list of modems
- new "override-setting" command line parameter
- Several bug fixes


Have fun and thanks in advance for your feedback!

Jonas Wolz.

1) The README.TXT in the rc still reads 0.4.3 (1st line)

2) How does the modem list feature work?
If you input a modem list manually, which one will be used when
sending? All of them? Meaning the client will tell the server "use one
of these"?

Thanks

Thanks! I changed this in the README now...

The client will send the modem name entered as "HylaFAX name" for the modem 
selected by the user in the send dialog.

The reason for this feature is that when you have defined modem groups in the 
HylaFAX config, YajHFC has no way to automatically determine these (YajHFC 
only sees the physical modems).

So, when you use modem groups, so far the user had to enter the group's name 
manually to send modems using that group.
With the modem list feature you can add the modem groups to the YajHFC modem 
list to allow a more user-friendly selection.


I hope this clarifies it a bit...


Jonas.

Hi,
I would like to know how to tell Hylafax which modem to use.
I have twelve modem installed (DIVA analog) but when I choose
a modem from drop-down menu, hylafax sends faxes always with the first modem 
(first free, I suppose).
I tried to submit a fax from command line (senfax with -h option) and it works 
with selected modem.
I'm sure this is for my ignorance... but I need a help.
Sorry for my English, I'm italian.

Thanks a lot and compliments

Actually it should work like you described it: When you select a modem from 
the drop down box in the send dialog, the fax should be sent with the 
selected modem.

Could you send me (by private mail) a debug log for YajHFC?

To create such a log, please start YajHFC using the "YajHFC (debug mode)" link 
in the start menu (if you use Windows, else please use 
the "--debug --logfile=<logfile>" command line parameters) and then try 
sending a fax while selecting a modem different from the first.
Then, quit YajHFC and send me the log file it produced.

Thanks

The builds at the above URL have been updated with the Chinese, Italian, 
Russian and Spanish translations (thanks to all translators for their fast 
response!).
