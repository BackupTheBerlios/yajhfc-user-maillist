I guess that this is the error:

Error #-2147024664:

I'm attaching the logs. Note that my actions were:
print from Notepad to yajhfc virtual printer -> yajhfc
appeared on screen without the "send dialog box" -> I
checked that the recvq and doneq tabs were loaded
correclty -> I pressed the "send button" on the
toolbar and it correclty displayed the window -> quit
application.

Yes. The problem was that your fax server obviously has a modem without a 
phone number assigned and I didn't correctly handle that case in YajHFC.

Please try the version at ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc.jar and 
see if it fixes the problem (this version is almost completely identical to 
0.3.6 but has that error fixed).

Thanks,
Jonas

I can confirm that it works.
I've put 0.3.6. in production use now.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <2D0C74CC0A8DCB43AA46948B4A368D5301323C0F@saracen.symac.local>

When I try to preview a fax in the Send Fax window GSView tries to open
the tmp file from the Windows\System32\Settings\Temp folder. But the tmp
file is in fact in C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local
Settings\Temp
 
Is there a setting that I can change to resolve this?

YajHFC uses whatever Java thinks the Temp directory is.
Java usually just takes the value from the environment variable TEMP for it.

The problem is that when invoking YajHFC over Redmon that environment variable 
is often incorrectly set and thus the wrong directory is used. In that case 
the easiest solution is just to use the wrapper script from
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/download/yajhfc-launcher.zip

Else, you can also manually override Java's selection by starting YajHFC with 
a command line like:
java -Djava.io.tmpdir=[desired temp directory] -jar /path/to/yajhfc.jar

For example:
java -Djava.io.tmpdir="C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local 
Settings\Temp" -jar "c:\program files\yajhfc.jar"


Hope that helps,
Jonas
