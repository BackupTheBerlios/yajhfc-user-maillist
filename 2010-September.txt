Subject: [Yajhfc-user] yajhfc just disconnecting
Message-ID: <4C8F600B.70006@gmail.com>

  Hey Folks,

I've got a problem mit yajhfc disconnecting from my hylafax  server some 
time after it connected.

So when I try to establish a connection (starting the program oder 
selecting "Connect" from the menu), it's no problem, it connects, it 
updates recieved faxes, all seems to be working.

But after some time (randomly, some minutes perhaps) it just 
disconnects. Reconnecting is possible and faxes can then be recieved 
again but it will randomly disconnect again.
The setup is:
Windows 7 x64 running yajhfc
Debian Server running hylafax
to log in i use the user uucp

This is what the log says:

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Issue with viewing received faxes as PDF
Message-ID: <20100916140530.6245BF81F@i3.golden.dom>

YajHFC 0.4.4, Windows 7 64bit.

If I set yajhfc to view received faxes w/o any conversion I can see the tiff
files ok.

If I set it up to view them as PDF, like this:

	Location of tiff2pdf executable: 
		C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\tiff2pdf.exe
	View faxes as single file: X
	Format for viewing: PDF
	View faxes always in this format: X	
	
then when I double click on a received fax I get an error:

========== error
	An error occured displaying the fax "fax000011945.tif":
	Premature end of stream reading stdout from tiff2pdf
(readLen=-1,buflen=-1).

Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM

==========

If I enable the "Log console" and select "Log level: FINEST" I don't get any
info.

What is the exact command line used by yajhfc?

If I view the fax as tiff (no conversion), save it to disk, and then convert
it by hand
C:\a>"c:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\tiff2pdf.exe"
			 fax7032146836801140192.tiff -o fax.pdf
I get a valid PDF file, so tiff2pdf seems to be working.

Thanks

Hmm, it is quite difficult to say what the reason is. The log messages you 
have quoted are basically just subsequent faults from the fact that the 
connection closed unexpectedly.
Do you know which side disconnects (the server or the client)?

And, would it be possible for you to send me a complete log (by private mail)?

Thanks
Jonas

This is a bug with tiff2pdf and Windows Vista/7 (see below for details).

"tiff2pdf inputfile"

If you use "tiff2pdf inputfile > outputfile" (instead of "-o outputfile"), you 
will probably get a crash from tiff2pdf.

As a workaround I have created the following batch file:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/tiff2pdf.cmd

Download it, copy it to the directory where tiff2pdf.exe is and then setup 
YajHFC to use tiff2pdf.cmd instead of tiff2pdf.exe 

Hope that helps
Jonas

Hi

I'm looking for a client that does exactly the same as winprinthylafax.
All I need it to do is ask for the fax number and send it to the server when it gets a file passed to it.
Would it be possible to get a cut down version of yajhfc to do this?

Thx

YajHFC already has a "send only" mode where only the send dialog is shown.
If this is sufficient for you, you can already do this with the current 
version.

If you need/want a send dialog with reduced options (or a version which only 
can show such a dialog), this would be theoretically possible, too, of 
course.
I am quite hesitant to implement something like that, however, since I do not 
see a good reason why something like that would be so much better than having 
a full featured version...

Hope that helps
Jonas

Hi Jonas,

I'm also using your client and I really think it's works quite good (even if it's Java :) ).

But I would also like to see your client split up in two packages:
- Basic version for sending only, no GUI (except the send GUI, address book, ...)
- Add-On to the basic version with fully featured GUI

The reason is that we only have one fax server. Incoming faxes are distributed by mail.
But some faxes are not for everyone. I actually don't want some users to see them.
If someone is a bit technically interested he would find the GUI and can watch all the faxes.
On the other hand they should be able to send faxes.

Thanks,
Klaus

You should solve this issue on the server side, by applying proper
security to the received faxes, so that you don't have to rely on what
users install on their systems.

See recvfilemode parameter and/or apply proper uid/gid in FaxDispatch.

In an ideal world, yes

But I don't have the time to create usernames/passwords for every user I have, make sure they have hylafax rights and then make sure the passwords sync with AD. Maybe when there is a far simpler and robust method of doing this in linux than the 2 or 3 cobbled together workarounds currently available, I'll do it, but until then, hylafax gets 1 user.

In any case, my users don't want to have to learn *another* client program, they want to print, get the delivery confirmation and forget it.
I know its not a difficult program to use, but it is another thing to juggle.

Maybe I will consider creating a separate "send only" version in a future 
version, but this does not have a very high priority for me (most likely it 
won't come this year).
Especially it does not make sense to me to create a clone of winprinthylafax 
(if I wanted to do that it would probably be easier to create a fork of that 
project which works with Windows 7...) -- so what you would probably get is 
a "send dialog only" version of YajHFC.

And, as Giulio put it, such a stripped down client is *not* a safe security 
measure, since trying to put the security measures on the client and not the 
server will usually allow the user to circumvent them.
This is especially true in the case of HylaFAX whose protocol is based on FTP 
and thus allows to access the faxes with any FTP client -- if you know what 
you are doing (which is admittedly not very likely for your average user, 
however).

If your environment is:
- received faxes routed via email manually by someone
- noone should see the received faxes via an hylafax client, but only
through email

Then you just need
    RecvFileMode: 0600
I think, no need for uid's.

why don't you get hylafax use your AD via PAM (winbind) for checking
credentials? It should work ouf of the box, did you try it?

I've never been able to get that to work out "of the box"

I've been trying all day to get pam to authenticate, I've tried ldap, winbind and radius, none of which have worked.
the radius one is even seeing the username, but not authenticating. I love linux, but when it comes to authenticating outside of the local box, it's a pain in the bits

I have it working with LDAP and even AD. The complete system
authenticate local users against an LDAP, so once pam_ldap has been
configured, I only wrote an /etc/pam.d/hylafax including all common-*
files.

I understand this list if for a client software, so you may send me
private emails in order to not be mush OT, but, would you care to
describe what problems you found?

Bye,
Giuseppe

Hi,

the thing with security is actually pretty bad.
If you only have one fax extension you just have the possibility to secure all or no faxes.

The thing with RecvFileMode: 0600 has some drawbacks:
- Nobody will be able to display the faxes (so there's no need for a fully featured fax client at all)
- You're not able to watch the content, but the faxes still appear in the received/sent fax list

Just consider the following scenario:
- Small company with 10 employees, no Exchange Server (only POP3)
- Incoming faxes go to the secretaries mailbox and will be distributed from there
- The boss doesn't want the faxes in the mailbox, but wants to be able to display them anytime (without having access to the secretaries mailbox)
- All other users should only be able to send faxes

RecvFileMode: 0600 will prevent also the boss from displaying faxes.

In my opinion the only chance to implement that scenario is on the client side.
- Fully featured client for the boss and the secretary
- Send only client for all others

And you still have the HylaFAX logon table with user and password (even if it's not the safest method).

The only thing that needs to be implemented:
- If you "upgrade" from the send-only to the fully featured version you need to enter the password again (which the end user doesn't know).

If anyone has another solution for that scenario, please tell me.

Thanks, Klaus


BTW: Another cool thing would be a centralized management option split up in a global and an user specific part (two files).

why don't you get hylafax use your AD via PAM (winbind) for checking credentials? It should work ouf of the box, did you try it?

Right, but this doesn't means that no users or all users will have
access rights to all received faxes.

Using RecvFileMode you may restrict access to groups. Normally faxes are
owned by uucp:uucp, so 0600 means that only uucp user may access them,
but if you create a group TrustedFaxReaders, and add all trusted users
and uucp user to that group, set RecvFileMode to 0660 and change group
ownership or received faxes in bin/faxrcvd script, you probably get what
you need.

Bye,
Giuseppe
