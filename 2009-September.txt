Java has a bug that prevents YajHFC from saving its settings when it is still 
running (in the system tray) while the user logs off.
This does not happen always and on every computer (this problem seems much 
more likely on Windows Vista/7 than on XP; it does never occur on Linux).

The next version of YajHFC (0.4.2; will be released soon) will include a work 
around that hopefully fixes this problem.


Hope that helps
Jonas

Message-ID: <200909272023.46028.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

I am pleased to announce that version 0.4.2 of YajHFC has been released today.

Download:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_4_2.jar

Source code:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_4_2-src.zip

Windows setup.exe:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_4_2-setup.exe


New features/changes:
- Polish translation added
- Support to read recipients from text files
- Desired window state can be specified on the command line
- "Send only mode" without display of main window (when a 
  document to send and neither --background nor --noclose is specified)
- Arbitrary HylaFAX options can be specified for new fax jobs
- Work around for a Java bug causing YajHFC not saving its settings when it is 
  still running while the user logs off on Windows 7, Vista and (sometimes) XP
  (if this still does not work for you, please write me a mail since this
   problem is quite hard to debug)
- Default cover page is now HTML to avoid problems with non ISO-8859-1   
  characters
- The Windows setup will now optionally install tiff2pdf and GhostScript
- Various other bug fixes, improvements and code cleanup

Known problems:
- The Greek translation is incomplete (volunteers to complete it are welcome!)

Have Fun,
Jonas

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Kerberos
Message-ID: <20090929143624.tt2azwyu3h8g0448@www.umrk.nl>

Hi all,

A while back I was disappointed to learn that the Hylafax protocol was  
basically just extended FTP. It's therefore "firewall unfriendly" and  
sends login names and passwords in the clear.

There may be nothing that we can do about the firewall unfriendliness,  
but have there been any attempts yet to use Kerberos for  
authentication? If so, would this work together with yajhfc?

Thanks,

Jaap

None I know of (I have not searched for such attempts, however).
Maybe it could be helpful to ask this question on a HylaFAX mailing list, too.

> If so, would this work together with yajhfc? 

Currently: No. 
If there is a HylaFAX version which implements such a authentication method, I 
would consider adding support for it to YajHFC, however.


Hope that helps,
Jonas
