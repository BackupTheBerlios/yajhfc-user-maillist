Subject: [Yajhfc-user] YajHFC 0.5.0beta
Message-ID: <201012311640.23998.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

A beta version for YajHFC 0.5.0 has been made available today.

You can find it in the following directory:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/beta/

This version incorporates major changes in the architecture the fax lists are 
loaded, which will offer much more flexibility in the possible sources of the 
list data and will probably make it easier to offer multiple server support 
some time in the future (although still much work needs to be done for the 
latter; this feature won't necessarily come with 0.5.0).

Because of this rather major change, I decided to put out a beta early (it 
might still take some months before 0.5.0 gets released).
I will be happy about any positive or negative feedback regarding this change 
(especially new bugs, performance problems, ...).

User-visible changes are:

- Support for local caching of the fax lists, probably making the start-up of 
the application feel much quicker

- Experimental support for direct reading to the recvq and doneq directory, 
bypassing the HylaFAX server (and the HylaFAX user authentication). This 
might lead to a lower server load with large queues since only modified files 
are read to refresh the fax lists. This still needs some testing, however... 
(any feedback on this feature is very welcome!)

- Options dialog should open a bit faster than before

- "Test connection" button in the Options dialog


Happy New Year and happy testing!
Jonas Wolz

Thanks, this is a change I forgot to mention: 

The encoding/character set used for the HylaFAX server is now explicitely set 
(before it was whatever the default encoding of the client's OS was).

Please go to Options->Server and change the charset to what your platform 
default is and you should be fine again.


Hope that helps
Jonas
