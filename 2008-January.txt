Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Error trying to Re-send a failed Fax
Message-ID: <B55301ABE760AA49BE5ADB32BF27A336086136@claims-new>

I'm running Vista (which continues to be a source of several issues J)

 

One problem in particular is that if I try to re-send a fax, I get the
attached error dialog.  It's basically a NullPointerException.

I am pretty sure this worked fine for me when I was running XP, so I am
wondering if this is a Vista problem, and how it may be fixed?

 

Also,  if I leave the Yajhfc console open after sending a fax from
<stdin>  and attempt to print another fax to <stdin> via redmon, It
typically fails on an error there too.  So long as I exit the
console/program after each send it seems pretty stable.
