Subject: [Yajhfc-user] YajHFC 0.5.0 released
Message-ID: <201104031111.48563.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

I am pleased to announce that version 0.5.0 of YajHFC has been released today.

Download:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_5_0.jar

Source code:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_5_0-src.zip

Windows setup.exe:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0_5_0-setup.exe

RPM packages:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-0.5.0-1.noarch.rpm
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-faxprinter-0.5.0-1.noarch.rpm

APT line to add to /etc/apt/sources.list for Debian/Ubuntu packages:
deb ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/repository/apt stable/

More information about the DEB packages:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/deb-packages-info-0.5.0.txt

Mac App:
http://prdownload.berlios.de/yajhfc/yajhfc-macapp-0.5.0.zip


New features/changes:
- Support for local caching of the fax lists, probably making the start-up of 
the application feel much quicker
- Experimental support for direct reading to the recvq and doneq directory, 
bypassing the HylaFAX server (and the HylaFAX user authentication). This 
might lead to a lower server load with large queues since only modified files 
are read to refresh the fax lists. This still needs some testing, however... 
(any feedback on this feature is very welcome!)
- Options dialog should open a bit faster than before
- "Test connection" button in the Options dialog
- Support for multiple servers
- Support for multiple identities
- Lists of faxes can be saved in CSV, HTML or XML format
- Support for configurable keyboard accelerators

Have Fun,
Jonas Wolz

Hi,

thanks for the new release Jonas.

I tried to build the sources, but seem to missing something,

    [javac] 
/home/met/Sources/yajhfc-0.5.0/src/yajhfc/HylaClientManager.java:129: 
cannot find symbol
     [javac] symbol  : method setCharacterEncoding(java.lang.String)
     [javac] location: class gnu.hylafax.HylaFAXClient
     [javac]                 
client.setCharacterEncoding(myopts.hylaFAXCharacterEncoding);

Building 0.4.4 works without problems using gnu-hylfax 1.0.3. Are using 
any other sources for that now?

Regards,
Christian

You will need to apply the patch from the following site to the gnu-hylafax 
sources:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=815237&aid=3148665&group_id=160285

Sorry for any inconvenience caused by this...


Hope that helps
Jonas

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] owner must be of type Dialog or Frame!
Message-ID: <393331.46846.qm@web113312.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've just upgraded my YAJHFC client installation in a test environment and all's fine when running the app in my Windows desktop environment but it seems to be failing within redmon (I used the installation wizard).

So when I print to the "YAJHFC Fax" printer I get an error and no USERNAME/PASSWORD dialog box opens. The error I'm getting is:

owner must be of type Dialog or Frame!

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: owner must be of type Dialog or Frame!

YajHFC 0.5.0
Java 1.5.0_12 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition 1.5.0_12-b04
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
Windows Vista 6.1 (x86)

How can I fix this issue?

Thanks,
