Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Questions about YajHFC
Message-ID: <1243948367.8641.43.camel@kant.localdomain>

Hello list,

I have searched the available documentation and tested some
configurations, but did not find satisfying answers. Perhaps someone can
answer my questions concerning the behaviour and/or configuration of
YajHFC.

The client-version is 0.4.0. It was installed via "setup.exe" in Windows
XP SP3 with JRE 6 Update 11.


1. From documentation I expect the command line argument "--background"
to behave like, starting the Client, give the pop-up for entering the
fax-number, submit the document to the server, close the client.
Is this assumption right?
If I modify the VB-script (delivered with "setup.exe"), which is called
if sending fax via installed printer, to get also this "--background"
setting (beside the other standard-settings from the registry), this
seems not to work.
The behaviour is: the client starts up, the main-window and the
send-dialog pop up, I give the number, the fax is transmitted to the
server, the client keeps up and does not stop (like expected).


2. Is it possible to start YajHFC minimized to the system-tray (i.e.
without showing the main-window and logging-in information)?


3. Everytime a fax is sent via the printer the main-window and the
send-dialog pop up. Can this be configured to open only the send-dialog
(not the main-window)?


Many thanks in advance
Sincerely
Andreas Ruf

No, it is the opposite way: Without --background you should get the behaviour 
you expect.

--background means "leave an instance running in the background after the fax 
has been submitted" (looking at it again, the documentation may be a bit 
misleading here...).

Both is not possible at the moment, but I will keep it on my list for possible 
future feature enhancements.


Hope that helps,

Will try this.

Would be nice if this could be configurable.

Message-ID: <de8c2ec00906090533l84f9d2dubc1722272e3003c3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Is there a way to get a column into yajhfc to display which modem a
particular fax was received on?

This is something that we would find usefull since we have added 8 modems
onto our fax server now, and makes it alot easier to track back to a
particular modem when we have had a problem.

Thanks

Andy

Hi,

I'm currently testing your HylaFAX client and I'm impressed. Thanks for your work.

My tests brought me to some issues/questions:

- When I've lost the connection HylaFAX (e.g. the server was restarted) YajHFC is in disconnected state. When I try to fax something after this happened the cmd.exe with cscript starts and just hangs. I see the splash screen and that's it. I've to kill and restart the YajHFC.

- I'm also interested in a "send only mode". I want the fax users are able to send faxes, but they shouldn't see the inbox.

- The PDF-conversion with libtiff for windows crashes under Windows Vista. Do you know some workaround/solution for that?

- Is it possible to put it YajHFC in autostart as tray-only (no main window)?

- Is it possible to add easily a command which will be executed by YajHFC before it connects to HylaFAX (I know for startup this could also be done by a script, but not after hibernation)? For notebook users I have sometimes the problem that the automatic DNS registrations takes some time. When the fax-client logs on it will be rejected because the DNS-IP differs from the notebook-IP.
  > Maybe this could be added directly to YajHFC that it registers the IP in DNS before starting a connection (this can be done with ipconfig /registerdns)?

- Is there a way of central configuration for the options?


So, that's it for the moment... :-)

Thanks, Klaus

None that I know of. As far as I know, HylaFAX does not offer this information 
for received faxes.

Probably the instance of YajHFC started by cscript waits until the 
disconnected instance is ready to send.
I will try to look into this more thorughly in the next days, though.

> - The PDF-conversion with libtiff for windows crashes under Windows Vista.

Yes, this is a bug in the libtiff-utils (it crashes when putput goes to 
stdout).
As a workaround, you can download the batch script at 
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/tiff2pdf.cmd, place it in the same 
directory as tiff2pdf.exe and tell YajHFC to use tiff2pdf.cmd instead of 
tiff2pdf.exe

Currently not, but this is already on the "wish list" for future versions.

Currently not.

Yes, see http://yajhfc.berlios.de/doc/faq.html#SECTION00039000000000000000
Alternatively, you can just copy the $HOME/.yajhfc/settings file between user 
profiles to specify default settings for a specific user.

Hope that helps,
Jonas

Message-ID: <de8c2ec00906110408r550dafd6wfafcdab6ab326889@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi

We have are going to soon be deploying more modems onto our Hylafax server
for different departments, we have been running Hylafax just with 1 modem
with no problems.

With adding more modems, we are looking at using yajhfc so the different
departments can view and manage their own received fax lists.

I know under the View menu there is "View Own Faxes" option, but how do I
setup Hylafax with Yajhfc to take advantage of this option so say the other
departmetns can't see each other received fax lists.

Currently the modems are setup under defaulf owners of uucp:uucp, and I
intend to give each department a general username for the department which
they will run Hylafax with, which I would like to somehow assign to say a
particular modem for each dpeartment.
Is this easily done with a couple of config changes somewhere, or do I need
to look much deeper.

Thanks

Andy

Try different users in "hosts.hfaxd" ("man faxadduser") for each
department and option "JobProtection" in "hfaxd.conf" ("man hfaxd").
Perhaps this is what you want?
