</I>
I think I have found a way to manually create a fax printer with YajHFC and 
RedmonEE (but tested it only with WinXP SP3, so I do not know if it works 
with W2K3).

Please download <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/redmonee.zip">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/redmonee.zip</A> and read the 
file &quot;install.html&quot; in that archive for a (very) short guide on how to do 
that (it would be nice if you could give me a short feedback if it worked for 
you or if you still have problems).

The basic idea for using RedmonEE with YajHFC is as follows:
You can't directly run a GUI application that receives the printed data with 
RedmonEE as you can do with Redmon. So you have to save that data in a 
temporary file first (which is accomplished by savein.vbs).
Then, you can use the ability of RedmonEE to start an application after the 
job has been printed to invoke YajHFC (using execyajhfc.vbs).

Currently this approach still has the problem that the temporary file will get 
overwritten if the same user prints to the fax printer while the YajHFC send 
dialog is still open (because the file's content will copied to the server 
only after the user clicked on &quot;Send&quot;).
This is probably solvable, but requires some more work on my side.

I can not promise when/if RedmonEE will be integrated into the setup, but I 
will consider it for one of the next releases (probably only as an option, 
not as default (except for Windows Server OSes)).

Hope that helps,
Jonas
