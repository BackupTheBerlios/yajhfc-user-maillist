Hi Jonas,

I suddenly can't send email to @freenet.de because:
"
194.97.50.153 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550 Submission from dynamic IP
requires authentication Giving up on 194.97.50.153.
"

Our MX don't have dynamic IPs so it's probably a spam
measure based on IP ranges not well updated.

Anyway I subscribed to this list and it may very well
be the fisrt post...

So here's the answer to the message you sent me
yesterday:

From: Jonas Wolz :
> For me it looks like HylaFAX is trying to do a line
continuation using 
> a backslash there (The first line has "\" as status,
the second has the real status message in the first
column and the third line contains the rest of the
"logical > line" offset by 2 columns).
> 
> Attached to this mail you will find a YajHFC version
with a small

rest of the code is identical to 0.3.2).

Thank you Jonas, your new code solves the problem.
Hylafax job 366 which was "behaving badly" due to the
backslash is now displayed correctly.
I will simply rename the new code to 0.3.2 so that our
users don't notice anything.

Regards,

Vieri
