Hi everybody, I'm new to Hylafax and YajHFC client,
I have a problem when trying to resend a fax in the sent table (a fax 
that belong to me or someother) I get the error in object.
I think it's a server side problem (maybe I have to change some 
permission) but I don't know where to start.
Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance.
Cristian.

Hi everybody,
I have installed yajhfc on many XP client and everything went fine,
now I'm trying to make it working on a server win 2000, it seems that

send the fax or make a preview an error occurs:

I think you cannot send text files. The only accepted formats arer tiff,
ps an pdf. Other files need to be "printed" by windows and converted in
PS by the printer driver.

I forgot  to say that I'm trying to send via the fax printer. Maybe 
there is something wrong with the driver.
The other machines (Win XPw) here I installed the client are not 
affected by this problem.
Thank's

Can you view the fax in question?

AFAIK, permissions for HylaFAX users are determined by the Unix group 
permissions for the files corresponding to the fax job.
A job usually consists of one control file in the doneq (or sendq) directory 
and the documents attached to it in the docq directory.

In order to be able to read a job parameter or view an attached document, the 
group id of the files for the job must be the same as the HylaFAX (!) user id 
of the user or the "other" Unix permission must allow reading of the file (I 
think).

Hope that helps,
Jonas

Probably YajHFC does not recognize the PostScript produced by the printer 
driver as PostScript.

To debug this problem, please create a debug log from Redmon:
To turn it on, go to the properties of the YajHFC printer, go to the "Ports" 
tab, select the "YAJHFC:" port, click "Configure...", click "Log file" and 
check both the "Use log file" and "Debug" boxes (and enter a different log 
file name if you wish). Then close all dialogs with "OK".
(also see the screenshot at http://yajhfc.berlios.de/temp/redmon-debug.png )

Then, print a document on the YajHFC printer and send the produced log to me.


Thanks
Jonas

Hello,

it looks like the cscript.exe process is not starting.
In your log, you are getting the following lines:

> [...]
> REDMON WriteThread: started
>   Level=1
>     DocumentName="statuto1.pdf"
>     OutputFile="(null)"
>     Datatype="RAW"

> REDMON check_process: process isn't running.
> REDMON check_process: flushing child stdin to unblock WriteThread.
> %!PS-Adobe-3.0
> [...]

In a successful run, you should see two lines printed from cscript.exe, like 
that:
> [...]
> REDMON WriteThread: started
>   Level=1

I already had reports that using Redmon on Windows Server OSes is often quite 
problematic. So your best bet may be trying to install a fax printer manually 
using RedmonEE.

To do so, first download and install RedmonEE from http://www.is-foehr.com/.
Then, download ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/redmonee.zip and read the 
file "install.html" in that archive for a (very) short guide on how to install 
a fax printer with YajHFC using RedmonEE.

If you have any questions about that, please write me another mail. 
If it works for you, a (short) "success message" would be nice, too.


Hope that helps
Jonas

This error probably comes from the fact that you entered no password (and just 
clicked "OK").
Nevertheless, this is not the source of the problem...

Which version of HylaFAX do you use?
Does connecting and listing faxes work with other clients? (e.g. 
do "faxstat -r" and "faxstat -d" work on the server?)

If other clients work, please send me a debug log from YajHFC. To do so, run 
YajHFC with the command 
java -jar yajhfc-0_4_2a.jar --debug --logfile=yajhfc.log

Then, try to log in and send me yajhfc.log.

Hope that helps
Jonas

After restart it is working now OK.
I'm using now hylafax-6.0.3.

Those setting must have changed when I upgraded from ver. 4 to 6.

Currently you cannot select multiple files in the file browse dialog. 
Changing that behaviour for the next release should not be a big problem, 
however.

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] YajHFC Windows setup with RedmonEE support
Message-ID: <200912241617.28363.jonas.wolz@freenet.de>

Because of several recent requests for Terminal server support for the YajHFC 
fax printer, I created a new (experimental) Windows setup that optionally 
uses RedmonEE instead of the "normal" Redmon to implement that printer.

According to its documentation, the fax printer using RedmonEE should work 
flawlessly in terminal server environments, but as I do not have a terminal 
server installation here, I cannot test if this indeed works or if there are 
still problems.

RedmonEE also works on workstation installations of Windows, so you can also 
use it there if you prefer. 
Nevertheless "normal" Redmon will stay default for YajHFC (except when the 
setup is run on a (terminal) server version of Windows), since RedmonEE 
itself is still beta software and only works with 32bit versions of Windows.

If you would like to test the new setup.exe, you can download it from here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0_4_2a-setup2.exe

To use RedmonEE, simply select the "RedmonEE" option in the "Select 
Components" step of the setup wizard.

If you have any questions/feedback about the new setup.exe, please just write 
me a mail or reply to this posting on the yajhfc-user list.

I would especially like to hear from you if you have tried out the new setup 
on a terminal server environment, so that I know if it works for you or if 
there are still some problems (but of course any other feedback is also very 
welcome!).

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year,
Jonas Wolz
