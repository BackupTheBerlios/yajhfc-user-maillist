Hi,
Firstly I have to say that this is by far the best hylafax client I
have used to date.
I have always had issues with designing coverpages for hylafax and it
is nice to see support for some "real" coverpages.
But (Theres always a but)
I have designed a coverpage in openoffice with the relevant tags (I
have even tried your supplied cover page (cover.odt)) and tried to use
it but I get the following errors:
The .odt file has been converted to .fo and I'm trying to preview it.

Error viewing the FO file:

I used the installer which includes the FOP plugin to install the package.
In Options - Plugins: the plugin IS loaded and the app IS being
launched correctly:
"C:\Program Files\YajHFC\execyajhfc.vbs" --loadplugin=FOPPlugin.jar

yajhfc - 0.3.9
fop plugin - 0.1.1
java.runtime.version - 1.6.0_11-b03

Any help would be appreciated.

Steve

Thanks for the bug report. It seems that the launcher script (execyajhfc.vbs) 
from version 0.3.9 has a bug which sometimes causes it to set an incorrect 
class path for the FOP plugin.

So, please replace c:\program files\yajhfc\execyajhfc.vbs with the updated 
version from ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/execyajhfc.vbs and try 
again.

If it still does not work, it would be helpful if you could mail be a sample 
ODT file with which you are having problems.


Best regards,
Jonas

Thanks it now works, with a few issues however.
1. The cover page isn't the same as the odt file, but I believe that
is an issue with FOP and I need to keep playing around until I get it
"looking" right.
2. The fax cover cannot be in a location that has spaces eg c:\program
files but I figured out that by using progra~1 instead does work.

Thanks very much,  Now if I can only get the fax cover to look the
same as my ODT file that would be the cherry on the top.

Sorry but it seems my enthusiasm was a little premature.
It works when:
I open Yajhfc,
Select send, the send dialog opens,
I choose a fax number (from a db table, works great, thanks)
My cover page is already selected (set up in extras - options -
delivery) and the details are filled in automatically
I press send
It warns me that no files are selected and it will send just the coverpage
I agree
it then sends the fax  (coverpage only.)
I receive it.

It doesn't work when:
I open a document (as and example notepad with some text)
Select print - > yajhfc
A cscript.exe dialog appears but doesn't close, when I close it
manually only then does the yajhfc app appear.
for some reason in the file(s) section the following appears:
Files\YajHFC\FOPPlugin.jar (I have tried removing this but it still
doesn't work)
I choose a fax number (as above)
my cover page is already selected (as above)
I press send
I get the following error:

yajhfc.faxcover.Faxcover$InvalidCoverFormatException: Unsupported
cover page format!
	at yajhfc.faxcover.Faxcover.createInstanceForTemplate(Faxcover.java:213)
	at yajhfc.send.SendController.initFaxCover(SendController.java:111)
	at yajhfc.send.SendController$SendWorker.doWork(SendController.java:289)
	at yajhfc.ProgressWorker.run(ProgressWorker.java:176)

Remember this is the SAME fax cover that I used in the previous step.

If you need any more info please let me know

Steve

Please download and install the new setup package from
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/yajhfc/temp/yajhfc-0_4_0beta6-FOPPlugin-0_1_3-setup.exe
and try if this version fixes the problem.
It should now support fax cover pages that are in a path with spaces, too.

I hope this version does not have any more "spaces in a path" related 
problems. If you find one, please let me know, however.
(Such problems are sometimes overlooked in my tests because my primary test 
platforms are Linux and the German version of Windows XP, which both have 
less spaces in their paths than an English Windows (for the latter "C:
\Program Files" is localized to "C:\Programme", for example).)

The layout differences between the ODT file and the FOP output probably do not 
have changed, though. 
The reason for this is the way YajHFC's ODT support currently works: 
It uses a (third-party) XSLT stylesheet to transform the ODT file into FO 
format and then uses FOP to convert the FO file to PDF.
Since the ODT->FO transformation is not perfect (and probably never can be) 
some layout differences are virtually unavoidable.
If you have serious problems with a certain layout construct, however, please 
let me know (maybe there are some improvements which can be made).


Thanks,
Jonas.

Perfect, Thanks alot,
Spaces in filenames - works.
Fax cover - works.
Send document including fax cover - works.

I'm not going to bother with messing around with the fax cover format,
 I have used your example and made some minor changes to suite my
needs.
Could I ask where did/do you find tff2pdf.exe?

Thanks again for the help
Steve

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] Yajhfc "printer" on linux client
Message-ID: <4991ABFB.4060903@lauserco.com>

Hello,
In order to create a "printer" in linux, I've created a "print-to file" 
printer, that calls yajhfc.jar with the option --stdin, like the one in 
windoze does. This is my setup:
Create a local port in order to make print to file:

==========Cut Here=================

#!/usr/bin/perl
use IO::Socket::INET;
#( $port, $prfile ) = @ARGV;
$port=19100;
$prfile=/tmp/prtofil;
# print "port=$port file=$prfile $!\n";
$psrv=IO::Socket::INET->new(LocalPort => $port,Type=>SOCK_STREAM,Reuse=>1,Listen=>1) or die "Error! It seems like port $port is used $!\n";
while ($pjob=$psrv->accept()) {
    open(J,">$prfile") or die "Error writing to $prfile $!\n";
    while (<$pjob>) {
	print J "$_";
	}
    close J;
    system ("/bin/cat", $prfile, "| sudo -u myusername /usr/bin/java -jar /usr/local/bin/yajhfc.jar --stdin --bckground", ">>/tmp/result 2>&1") ;
    close $pjob;
    }

===========Cut Here=================

then, in cups I configured a printer called "Yajhfc" type Apple 
LaserWriter 12/600 PS (to be able to print any type of file - otherwise 
I will be forced to print only PS, PDF, JPG...). The connection for this 
printer is "socket://127.0.0.1:19100".
That's it!

I used innounp (http://innounp.sourceforge.net/) to unpack the

To install the fax printer the YajHFC setup uses some custom code written in 
InnoSetup's RemObject Pascal language ([code] section in the .iss file).
I have never used innounp, but it seems that it does not extract this code 
correctly, so that these functions are missing.

Personally (especially for internal deployment), I would rather create some 
kind of "wrapper" around the setup executables of YajHFC, gs and tiff2pdf.
If you want to do that, you can use "/SILENT" switch to do a silent 
installation with the YajHFC (and tiff2pdf) setup for example (see the Inno 
Setup help or 
http://unattended.sourceforge.net/InnoSetup_Switches_ExitCodes.html for 
details).


Hope that helps,
Jonas

Yeah, I thought so... Could that be possible for me to see that [code] 
section that you are using? It will be very helpful.

True, but I have to use the recompiled version of your program, the one 
with only "View own Faxes" enabled, so it will be better if I can repack 
everything.

I am aware of that, that's the way I do the deployment.

Thank You, and congratulations! Your program is the only one that I 
found, working flawless on our heterogenous network of windows, linux 
and macs. With the added "printer" option in linux and mac it has a 
perfecly identical behaviour on all platforms. I am preparing the 
deployment and, while the linux (and mac) users are "technically wiser" 
and fully capable of running the deployment script, unfortunately, for 
the windows users it will be a job for the technical department, so I'm 
trying to do an "one-shoot" installer with all the optional components 
already in. There are some other technical difficulties, like keeping in 
sync the usernames/passwords from hylafax with the ldap ones, but that 
is not my concern for the moment.

You can get the original .iss file via CVS, for example by using the following 
link:
http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/yajhfc/extra/winsetup/setup.iss?view=co

BTW: 0.4.0beta already includes the enhancement from 
http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/yajhfc-user/2008-December/000155.html
So, recompiling probably should not be necessary any more for that feature.


HTH,
Jonas

Subject: [Yajhfc-user] restrict fax modems to specific fax users
Message-ID: <509442.21512.qm@web32606.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I would like to restrict the use of outgoing fax modems to specific users.

Say, users 1,2,3 and 4 can only send faxes out on modem 1.
Users 5,6,7 can only send out on modem 2, etc.

Is it possible to associate a user with a modem, or better yet, a modem with a set of users?

I suppose setting this security measure would be better on the hylafax server than on the client but I haven't yet discovered how to do it.

Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Vieri

Hi,

There is an option within yajhfc to choose a modem, but for large
deployments this can be an administritive burden, i'm not sure if you
can restrict a user to ONLY use that modem however.
To assign users to a secific modem in hylafax itself is very easy, but
again to explicitly restrict them from using another I'm not sure,
although I'm sure it can be done.

To assign a modem to a user do the following:
(Adjust paths to suite your installation)

On the hylafax server edit:
/var/spool/hylafax/etc/config
ADD
JobControlCmd:          etc/jobcontrol

Then create the file:
/var/spool/hylafax/etc/jobcontrol
ADD
#!/bin/sh
. etc/setup.cache
. bin/common-functions
QFILE=sendq/q$1
parseQfile
case "$owner" in
root) echo "Modem: any";;
user1) echo "Modem: ttyS0";;
user2) echo "Modem: ttyS1";;
*) echo "Modem: ttyS2";;
esac
exit 0
Make sure you then configure the clients to log into the hylafax
server with the relevant user from above script (Perhaps you split
your users into relevant groups and name them accordingly)
Also make sure your /var/spool/hylafax/etc/hosts.hfaxd has the allowed users in.

Hope this helps

It definitely helps a lot! Especially the sample script.
Thanks for pointing out the JobControlCmd keyword that made me find this page: http://hylafax.sourceforge.net/man/jobcontrol.php

Have a nice weekend.

Hi,

When sending a fax with yajhfc, the "Modem" drop-down menu displays the tty modems and their FaxNumbers in parentheses as expected.

Could it be possible to display the modem groups instead (as defined in ModemGroup on the Hylafax server)?

Regards,

Vieri

PS: I don't really *need* this feature although I think it could be useful. So if it's too complicated to implement then please ignore it.

Not easily, because HylaFAX does not seem to offer a way to retrieve the 
defined ModemGroups from a client.

Thus, the only way to implement that would be to add an option to define the 
modem groups manually in YajHFC (overriding the list of modems from the 
server). 

I cannot promise that something like this will be implemented soon, however.

Best regards,
Jonas

Never mind, Jonas. It isn't important.

By the way, I hope YajHFC 0.4.0beta will be stabilized soon... ;-)

Does yajhfc mark send jobs to be archived? Does it let the user choose whether to archive the job or not?

I haven't found a specific option for this.
Maybe yajhfc specifies all jobs to be archived by default (-A) ?

Currently it does not have such an option and does not touch the "archive 
flag", so the server's default is used (which usually means not to archive 
jobs).

Adding such an options is a good idea, however, so very likely 0.4.1 will 
offer a way to set this flag.

This message comes from the HylaFAX server. Usually it only allows the owner 
of a sent fax to view the attached documents and resend the fax.

Unfortunately, there is not much one can do about that in the client (besides 
retrying to resend the fax in admin mode, of course).


HTH,
Jonas

Hi Jonas,
actual 0.4 beta release is very good for me (great job!!!).
I create a Global Phonebook with MySQL Database connected to the client
and it function very well.
Do you think it's possible in future release to save different
Distribution Lists, choosing names from General Phonebook, in order to
recall them for future usage ?

Thanks
Stefano Lusuardi

It is certainly possible (and a reasonable enhancement), so I put it on the 
wishlist for features that may be implemented in the future.

Nevertheless, implementing this feature will probably require some work, so I 
can not promise at the moment that it will already be implemented in the next 
release.

Jonas.

Generally the mapping between UIDs and user names is done in hosts.hfaxd in 
HylaFAX.

It seems, however, that the HylaFAX server does not map UIDs back to user 
names when it lists the received faxes, so you see a numeric ID in YajHFC.

Unfortunately, it seems that there is no way for a HylaFAX client to resolve  
a UID into a user name (or a user name into a UID), so there is not much I 
can do about that in YajHFC (BTW: If someone knows how to do such a 
resolution, please let know).


Jonas.
